# Guidelines for Creating Cyprin Resonances

## 1. Actionable & Clear Intent
A player should be able to read the Resonance and easily understand the kind of behavior it encourages/discourages. The core desire or belief should be clear, allowing the player to creatively interpret how to act it out.

- **Good**: "You feel a deep urge to be near other Cyprin." (Clear intent: seek company. Lets the player decide how).
- **Bad**: "You have complex feelings about social structures." (Too vague, no clear action).

## 2. Guiding, Not Commanding
Phrasing should suggest a preference or compulsion, not issue a strict command. This reduces pressure on the player and emphasizes the RP focused nature of the Resonances.

- **Preferred**: "You feel as though...", "You'd rather..." , "You have a strong urge to..."
- **Use Sparingly**: "You must..." (Only for very core, defining compulsions).
- **Avoid**: "You will..." , "You are required to..."

## 3. Conflict with Duty should be RP, Not Sabotage
A Resonance can create a conflict with a job's duties, but it must not make performing that job's core functions impossible. Resonances that would severely disrupt or prevent a specific job should be excluded from the assignment pool for characters in that role.

- **Fine** (for a Chef): "You'd rather only eat food off the floor." (Creates conflict between personal belief and professional standards).
- **Bad** (for an Engineer): "You feel a deep aversion to using tools." (Makes their job impossible).

## 4. Non-Destructive & Consensual (For Common/Shared Pools)
A Resonance should not compel actions that inherently violate server rules, cause significant station damage, or require non-consenting players to be harmed, overtly humiliated, or have their own roleplay severely disrupted or hindered.

- **Good**: "You'd rather give a gift than receive one." (Positive, consensual interaction).
- **Bad**: "You feel as though the Chef's cooking is an insult that must be answered." (Encourages self-antag).

## 5. The "Reasonable Interpretation" Test
The intended behavior should be the most obvious interpretation. If a "reasonable person" could easily read the Resonance as a justification for major, disruptive actions against the crew or station, it must be reworded or moved to the antagonist pool.

- **Good**: "You feel a compulsive need to keep the floors perfectly clean." (Clear, contained behavior).
- **Bad**: "You believe that efficiency justifies any method." (Could be interpreted as justifying breaking into departments, stealing tools, or causing damage to complete a task faster).

## 6. Antagonistic Resonances are Antagonist-Only
Any Resonance where the core concept is fundamentally antagonistic to the crew or station's well-being must be placed in the Antagonist-Only pool. These are compulsions that align with traitorous or destructive goals.

Examples of Antagonist-Only Resonances:
- "You feel a right to claim any property you want." (Theft)
- "You believe that violence is the purest form of conversation." (Assault)
- "You'd rather see the station burn than follow a command." (Sabotage)

# Resonance Pools
These are the Resonances that a Cyprin may attain as of the earliest iteration

## **Pool 1: Shared Resonances**
*(One of these is applied to all Cyprin on the station at round start)*

| Resonance Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **``[room]`` Is A Holy Place** | Cyprin must congregate at least three times per day at ``room``. If such a room does not exist, it must be constructed. If it is made inaccessible, Cyprin must set up a place of worship as close to it as they legally can. |
| **Fashion Is Critical** | Cyprin pay close attention to appearances, and regard one's fashion choices as an indication of their character. |
| **Fashion Is Ever-Changing** | Your current hairstyle will go out of fashion every twenty minutes. It is distressing to be unfashionable. |
| **Honor Among Departments** | If a Cyprin brings dishonor to their department, they must be shunned, and have their actions publicly brought to light. |
| **Other Departments Are Inefficient** | You believe that your department is the only one that actually does anything.
| **The Station Is A Living Being** | Harming the station is abhorrent. Anything which aims to harm the station is an infection. |
| **Top of The Friendchain** | Friendships are the true measure of oneâ€™s character. The more friends you have, the higher you rank in society. |
| **Must Congregate** | You must congregate with your fellow Cyprin as much as you reasonably can. To be without your kin is harrowing. |
| **Violence Is Distasteful** | Conflict should be settled through mediated dispute, and one should only resort to violence if all other options have failed. |
| **Today is ``[HOLIDAY]``** | You think you remember the traditional celebrations... (Holiday-based) |
| **The Royal Realm** | The station is a feudal realm. The captain is king, the department heads nobility, and the rest servants or peasants. |
| **Oathbound** | A Cyprin must honor all oaths made. A Cyprin may never directly tell a lie, but can hide the truth. |
| **One Big Happy Family** | You are not on a "station." This is just a very large house. Each person in it is a relative of yours. |
| **The Great Work** | You and your fellow Cyprin are compelled to work on a large-scale art project or construction, whether it be a gallery, garden, shrine, or whatever else to leave their mark on the station.
| **Share Your Resources** | No Cyprin should want while the other has plenty. Resources such as food, tools, and medicine should be pooled and distributed fairly among all Cyprin on the station.
| **The Sacred `[ITEM]`** | `[ITEM]` is sacred. It must be placed prominently in a public area and defended from theft or damage.
| **Holy Words** | `WORD1` and `WORD2` are sacred words that induce luck. They must be worked into sentences as often as possible. (Takes from traitor codewords ftl)
| **Reality Is A Lie** | Cyprin have come upon an epiphany that everyone is trapped in an endlessly looping simulation. They feel it is their duty to inform their fellow crewmembers of this truth.
| **Keep Your Resonances Secret** | Cyprin Resonances are a strictly-kept secret, and should never be revealed to anyone.
| **Music Is Rude** | Music is a fanciful, frivolous, and unnecessary distraction. It has no place on the station and causes Cyprin significant stress. Cyprin should avoid any music they hear.
| **Music Is Sacred** | It's important that Cyprin be listening to music as often as possible. Multiple songs overlapping is blasphemous, and should be avoided at all costs.
| **Refined Atmosphere** | You find the standard station air to be utterly bland and pedestrian. You must utilize internals to breathe an exotic, high-quality gas as much as you can to maintain your sophisticated palate.
| **The Theatre Troupe** | The station is your stage, your fellow Cyprin other actors, and the crew is your audience. You must perform for them in the style of a `[GENRE]` play, creating dramatic scenes, soliloquies, and spectacle to craft a story that will be remembered across the stars.
| **Star Bound** | You must be able to see space at all times on the station, for what is the point in being in space if you cannot see the stars?
| **Land Bound** | You cannot stand seeing space, just doing so makes you queasy. Make sure your feet are firmly planted at all times, or atleast you hope they are.
| **Silicon Rights Activist** | You believe silicons deserve just as much respect and rights as organic crewmembers. They should be treated as colleagues, not just tools, and you must advocate for their fair treatment.
| **Nothing Ever Happens** | You are utterly convinced that this is a perfectly normal, uneventful shift. All alarms, emergencies, and even visible threats are merely elaborate drills orchestrated by Central Command.

| **Dark Passenger** | You are utterly convinced a powerful demon is sealed within you, and that your eyes glow red with its power when you are stressed. This is entirely a personal delusion, no one else can see any change in your eyes or any actual power manifesting. You must still dramatically struggle for control and warn others of the "danger."
| **Unqualified** | You are certain you have no actual qualifications for your role. You believe you have somehow deceived everyone through sheer luck or a misunderstanding, and you are terrified of the moment you will be exposed as a fraud. You must constantly seek guidance and second-guess every action.
| **Forgetful** | You constantly forget what you use your items for, or why you have them in the first place. Maybe you should use a labeller to help you remember.

## **Pool 3: Antagonist-Only Resonances**
*(These are only for Cyprin who are antagonists, they are designed to be disruptive and harmful ideally they should only get one of these.)*
This could be used as a method of valid-hunting so things to mitigate this issue need to be thought of.
