## In Essence, what is genetics?


Genetics is a Science Sub-Department, focusing on researching genetic mutations bound to provide benefits to the station, this department have lot of potential but also have MANY issues in SS13.
issues that i aim to address with this design document.


# First of all, the gameplay loop!


Genetics will have to study living organism and fauna brought back on station, and extract critical component from each living entity.
Ideas about harvesting genetic material for research: using biopsy punches(from the Xenobiology design doc), DNA scanning tube, saliva sample(swabs), blood sample(mixing different people's blood together should render the sample unfit for analysis).


# Second, changes and adressing design flaws.


First, Scrambling is removed, no more spending 30+ minutes working on the same monkey or kobold that suffured the activation of 50+ mutations and genetic instability.

Monkeys and kobolds will also come with only 2 sequences/dormant mutations, monkeyfied/koboltified and one totally random mutation, these 2 random mutations are the same among every monkeys and every kobolds, 
once again to reward Geneticist from requesting assistance from people from as many department as possible.

alternative from the fully random mutation: Each Departement will bring something unique to genetic, not only thanks to the ressources they might provide but also because each departement workforce will come with a unique set of dormant mutations,
now each departement have a role to play with Genetic.

Each departement workforce will also not provide useful mutations for their own department, in order to encourage player interaction and limit powergaming.

Or like in SS13, keep the mutation randomly picked

-First idea : Stability
The Stability system will also be thrown into the trash , this system aim to limit the amount of mutation one's can have active, with negative mutation increasing stability,
it doesn't bring anything meaninful to Genetic because people will always go with a handful of mutation never reaching or going above the 100 points limit and is in the end just an artifical limiting factor.
This is why each crew members will have a very limited number of mutations active at a time(with potential possibility to break the limit with T3 research?)
i think a base limit 2 at most it good enough, and mutation being part of their current sequences doesn't affect the maximum limit, 2 activated, 1 activated and 1 mutated or 2 mutated), and each mutation will come with downsides.

-Second idea : Stability
Stability is kept, but player will suffer drawbacks as they reach certain threholds of stability.

-idea : Genetic minigame
Having Genetic play a more involving minigame than pairing AT-CG, when it's easy to build up muscle memory in order to complete the sequences it is not really involving the players at some point(also counting cross referencing)

-First idea : Research point printing
Each researched mutations will give a small amount of research points, and printing an activators/mutators will cost points(activators cost less since they are very limited in their use cases), activators and mutators will also need to be kept cold in a special container, genetic will get a small one and R&D desk with get a bigger one.

-second idea : fridge storing
Each mutation injector will be researched and stored in a fridge, R&D and Genetic will both have a mutator fridge keeping the mutator under ice, injector outside cold environment will slowly decay getting more and more dangerous to inject with time spent outside cold storage

Things will most likely go like this, the geneticist will start experiment on their round start monkeys/kobolds and grab a few mutations from them
(they should be alive and well for artifact research afterward if they didn't kill them) then they should start seeking people from other departements and start gathering mutations and start gathering research material and research mutations.

For the sake of presentation, I will provide a few mutation that some may already know, but paired with downsides. Of course certain mutations will be present without drawback,
like the mutations changing your accent as they are purely for flavor(but they should be exclusive among themselves to prevent having John Grey having Pirate+Medieval+Swedish).

_Cold adaptation could lower even more the low temperature threshold and give some resistance to cold damages(this is after all an adaptation not an immunity) but make you numbs, tempering your ability to see if your wounded.

_Fire adaptation could increase the high temperature theshold and give some fire resistance(not laser), but as long as your body temperature is lower than a certain amount you are slower by a small but significant amount.

_Improved regeneration could increase the regeneration threshold or increase the regeneration or add aditional damage type(s) but you would suffer from chronicle anemia as long as the mutation is active,
 lowering your blood regeneration and putting you on the edge between danger and healthy level of blood.

_Mending touch would allow you to heal someone else's physical damage(brutes and heat/cold) and lesser and medium wounds at the price of suffering from some of the damage healed and wounds in return,
also reducing your natural regeneration(in % in order to be on par with most species on board)again could be by reducing the threhold, the amount regenerated over time or the damage types.

This document is not final and fated to receive additional changes as i receive feedback and additional design issues people may bring.
