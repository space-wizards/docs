# Space Wizards Development Wiki

This is the `mdbook`-based developer documentation for all Space Wizards projects, including Robust Toolbox, Space Station 14, the SS14 launcher, etc. These docs cover many topics and can be potentially very useful for mappers, spriters, active contributors & prospective contributors, people who want to use our engine for their own projects, fork developers, and so on.

The site is currently hosted at [https://docs.spacestation14.com](https://docs.spacestation14.com).

Benefits of the current docs site infrastructure include:
- First-class git support, open source and actually editable by everyone
- Decently familiar & comfortable for developers since `mdbook` use is very widespread
- No sign-on infrastructure or hosting necessary (besides GH pages), if forks would like to host their own
- Very low friction to adding new pages and editing/fixing old ones
- High level of customizability with styling and easy custom scripting
- Eventual localization support

The following `mdbook` features & plugins are available and in use:
- `MathJax` support 
- Sidebar ToC (integrated directly into `index.hbs` etc)
- `mdbook-mermaid`
- `mdbook-linkcheck`
- `mdbook-template`
- `mdbook-admonish`
- `mdbook-emojicodes`
- `mdbook-embedify`
