# Cephalopod Species

## Overview

Cephalopods are a race of squids and octopuses that use moisture to breathe instead of air sources.
My ideas on their design plan follow two essentials: A "actions over words" play style, and utilizing the bizarre nature and biology of real world cephalopods to bring them unique weaknesses and strengths.



## Background

Squid faced aliens have been a staple in sci fi and fantasy for a long time. While I've never played space station 13, some wiki's talk about a humanoid with squid genetics being playable. This along with the squiddy cosmetic in 14 show their inclusion wouldn't be far fetched. Obsessed with cephalopods since childhood, I wholeheartedly believe the most intelligent invertebrates in real life should get some representation.


## Design

A way to put it bluntly, cephalopods follow a glass cannon philosophy of usefulness and uselessness.
All things about them are designed to be an equal scale that measures their survival skills to their physical weakness.

### Odd, but balanced
Their benefits outnumber their problems, but the severity of both let them teeter between being a little better or a lot worse than humans. The weird glares from coworkers as you kneel in anguish in front of the empty water cooler may sting, but the pain "washes away" after you become the hero for braving the spaced medbay and getting crit patients out alive. Not always the social type, they're rather difficult to be in positions of power.

## Specifics 

- There will be some system indication/display at Character Creation to inform the player what to expect (presumably, this system will also serve to provide basic info about other playable species)
  - Should use (or be integrated into) the Guidebook

- Cephalopods get oxygen from drinking water, or getting water on their skin
  - Examining one will say if they're Well Hydrated, Hydrated, Somewhat Dehydrated, Dehydrated.
    - They'll retain moisture for 20 minutes after max water absorbed, decreasing in these rankings as the time ticks down.
        - They'll also get slower in movement the less water in them.
    - The thirst warning activating means to immediately search out water, or they'll start suffocating after 60 seconds and immediately go critical.

- To revive one, the defibs need to be used three times, once for each heart. 
- They rot 2x faster than normal
- Rotting cephalopods release a toxic cloud of ammonia (Giant squids in real life contain a lethal amount in their flesh)

- Cephalopod blood is blue and contains copper. Their blood can be exchanged without problems with other blue blooded races.
- Their brain is a donut shape with multiple mini brain stems (octopus arms have their own autonomy in real life with these stems) branching from it, it's referred to as brains in game.
- When gibbed, they'll drop their gills, brains, stomach, eyes, ink sac, and hearts. 
 -Their hearts are one item called hearts, similar to the brains.
  -Their stomach is a curved tube
Clothing gimmicks
- Naked, their sprite will be flowing like the diona, but won't actually have a body. 
  - Their "body" is just their tentacles reaching all the way to the floor
  - They slip into clothes to show cultural respect to the others, even if it's not on their real body.
  - They cannot wear boots, gloves, or masks.

### Health and abilities
- Cephalopods can activate an ability to stick to the floor like mag boots, this will let them walk normally even in zero gravity.
 -It has a short cooldown that starts after you use it again to release.
  -Being damaged will also release the grip on the floor.
 
- They have a 20% chance of not dropping whatever is in their hands when disarmed (slipping in puddles, being stunned)

 - They do not need a pen in order to write on paper, lorewise they use their own ink. 

- They take +25% Piercing, and +10% more Slash damage than others
  - (To emulate how effective spearing is on sealife, and the classical depictions of cutting off tentacles of sea beasts.)

- They succumb to low pressure sickness and go critical in 100 seconds if they can't get out of the room, but only if exposed to it suddenly. 
   -If they wear a hardsuit with a helmet on first, enter the low pressure area, and then remove their helmet or suit, they'll acclimate to it and can survive even out in space (until they eventually freeze to death) 
   - They'll have to reacclimate to re enter the normal pressured areas by repeating the process.
- They also have high pressure resistence. No acclimation needed beforehand. 

- High temperature environments are particularly dangerous in long term exposure, as they spent their early lives in the coldest depths and warm tropical shallows. 

### Diet
A predatory race that can handle things like bread and cheese, but requires meat for actual nutrients. And of course, need to watch what fluids they drink.

- Still weak to any poisons humans are
- Can eat raw meat without ill effects
- Can only eat meat, other foods will build very small toxins that will need to be treated if too much is eaten.
- Alcohols are poisonous to them, so they can't head to the bar for something to breathe. 
- Sodas will still quench them, but not as efficiently as regular water.
- Adding salt to water will make it more potent in keeping them saturated.

### Color changing
Cephalopods over the years have gotten better at using their chromatophores that they can show how they're feeling without needing the ability to speak. 
The color wheel in the character customization menu will not let people choose colors that are too desaturated, but every color other than white and very light versions of colors is available.

- Cephs will lose or gain their color saturation with each level of water contained in them.
   -They also lose color depending on their damage.
- A dead one will be pale white. 
     - Choosing to be mute as a cephalopod, be it option or being the mime, will make you appear pale white at all times. Doctors will constantly rush up to you asking if you're fine.

## Language
- Cephs have no vocal chords. Or lungs.
- Chat messages when they speak imply this is them using their skins colors to communicate. No sound will play.
- Messages will begin with words like "mimics," "flashes," "strobes," "shifts," to show this

- As consequence, cephs can't whisper, speak on radio, or be heard over televisions, but can still use the hologram calls.


# Conclusive notes for now

- Makes satisfying suction cup noises when walking and letting go of objects
- I have attatched multiple images of visual design concepts for patterns and customization.

I'd die of happiness at any squids, octopi, nautilus, etc becoming playable. 
I'm not versed in code, but I am and know a few artists, and have a creative mind. If developers need my help if they decided this is good enough to add, I'll gladly work with them.
