## Welcome

This is the official developer's wiki for Space Station 14, a fully free and open-source remake of the cult-classic Space Station 14.

Whether you're a seasoned developer or this is your first time contributing to an open source project, this wiki provides the documentation, tutorials, and resources you'll need .

```admonish warning "Players Beware"
This is a **developer's wiki**. 

- If you are a player, you are looking for [the player wiki](https://wiki.spacestation14.io/wiki/Main_Page).
- If you are looking for API documentation, you are looking for the [DocFX page](https://spacestation14.com/space-station-14/index.html).
```

## Getting Started

If you're new to contributing or just new to Space Station 14, here is a rough roadmap to get you started:

- Follow the [Setting Up]() guide, which brings you through the process of setting up your local development environment (Git, .NET, IDEs, etc) and your Git repository (submodules, git tutorial).

- Familiarize yourself with our [Codebase Conventions](), which explains how the whole project is organized and gives guidance on how your code should look.

- Complete [SS14 By Example](), which brings you from nothing to adding new features and content to Space Station 14.

- Start contributing by working on and solving many of the [basic issues on GitHub](https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3A"Difficulty%3A+1-Easy") and talk with developers to get an idea for other things to work on.

- [Ask questions]()! Don't be afraid to ask for help.
