## Overview

Right now chemistry is the most boring sub-department. Every round – “silicon + nitrogen + potassium”, then “oxygen + plasma” and over, and over… Zero interaction with 99% of crew. This proposal contains potential solution of this problem. 

## Random reagents

Main idea of this proposal – make round start chem reagents and some reactions for base medical random-generated. How this will work? Round-start chem-dispenser will have reagents with random names and functional. Reactions for these reagents also will be random, for example, reagent 1 and reagent 2 can be mixed into powerful brute topical, reagent 2 and reagent 3 after mix will create explosion.

### Names of random reagents

Reagent's name will be generated from random prefixs and suffixs. Like a re, de, fi, gum for prefixs. And lin, line, valine, ac for suffixs.

### Random reagents in other places

Random reagents also can be obtained in other places: ordered in cargo (yes, ChemVend with it's pack will be deleted), gained from artefacts and slimes.

## Stable reagents

Some reagents will have permanent effects that can be very useful for chemist and force them interact with other departments. That’s some reagents for example:

    Space salt – will increase required damage for crit. Can be obtained from salty ore.
    Frezon – will allow use reagents on dead corpses.
    Aloe – will increase thermal protection and heal caustic damage.

These reagents should provide maximum effects only after mixing with random reagents from chem.
