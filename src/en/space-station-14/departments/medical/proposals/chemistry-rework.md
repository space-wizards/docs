## Overview
Right now chemistry is the most boring sub-department. Every round – “silicon + nitrogen + potassium”, then “oxygen + plasma” and over, and over… Zero interaction with 99% of crew. This proposal contains potential solution of this problem. 

## Random reagents
Main idea of this proposal – make round start chem reagents and some reactions for base medical random-generated. How this will work? Round-start chem-dispenser will have reagents with random names and functional. Reactions for these reagents also will be random, for example, reagent 1 and reagent 2 can be mixed into powerful brute topical, reagent 2 and reagent 3 after mix will create explosion.

### Random reagent reactions system
All random reagent reactions should take only two reagents and not require heating or catalysts. Idea of hotplate - make some reactions chemistry available only. With new chem, this idea will be a little bit irrelevant, because better ask chemists for working recipe, than get blown up durring mixing.
After mixing, new reagent will have more powerfull effect from two mixed ones, and one new, passive.
Base OD of every reagent will be 10u, but it can be randomly decraised during reactions (and should be checked on practice).

### Names of random reagents
Reagent's name will be generated from random prefixs and suffixs. Like a re, de, fi, gum for prefixs. And lin, line, valine, ac for suffixs.

### Random reagents in other places
Random reagents also can be obtained in other places: ordered in cargo, gained from artefacts and slimes.

## Stable reagents
Some reagents will have permanent effects that can be very useful for chemist and force them interact with other departments. That’s some reagents for example:

    Space salt – will increase required damage for crit. Can be obtained from salty ore.
    Frezon – will allow use reagents on dead corpses.
    Aloe – will increase thermal protection and heal caustic damage.

These reagents should provide maximum effects only after mixing with random reagents from chem.

## Equipment

#### Chemistry goggles
Chemistry goggles will get new function - now they will show effects on examine. This will allow chemists make a notes, that can be used for creating more powerful medicine for treating or used by other crew.

#### Vials
Volume of the vial will be recraised, but became explosion resistance. That will allow chemists experiment without fear of broken equipment.

#### Centrifuge
Centrifuge will get ability to split mixed random reagent into its components. So, there won't no way out situations, where all reagents was mixed into one puddle.

#### Some other staff
ChemDispenser - will be replaced with a crate with random reagents, because with random reactions it became fully useless.
Chemvend - will be deleted, new readents will be obtained in cargo, botany and etc.
Hotplate - will be deleted. As said earlier, it forced some reactions being chem-only. But with random reactions system it became useless.
ChemMaster - without changes.

## Chemistry in other places

#### Botany
Botany is the most interactive departament with chemistry. And the biggest part of reagents in plants will be replaced with a stable reagents.

### Syndicate things

#### Traitors
Syndi-chem synthesis kit will always include 2 vials with stable reagents: first - powerful stimulator, second - reagent that will "flip" effects of the reagent on being mixed. This will create enough space for creating dangerous toxins and powerful stimulators.

#### War-Ops
Probably, the most problem thing in this design-doc. Main part of preparation before invanding on the station - creating of the medicine and stimulators by the medic. I can't say, that this actually fun. Medicine for war-ops can actually moved into uplink. This will make healing in team less based on the skill of one player. And make nukie rounds faster and more dynamic.
