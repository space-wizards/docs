# Overview:

SS 14 is a remake. I think a remake should deepen or rework the ideas from the original. In space station 13 we have «a replica pod» that can revive dead person. But for that you need DNA of person, like blood. In most cases you don’t need replica pod because you have DNA for cloning and can just put body, brain or DNA samples in cloning pod , also you have defibrillator revival, surgical revival. AND, people don’t want play ugly grass people. This is why decide instead of replica pod made sunflowers. Sunflower common ghost role, and if you lost any ways to be revived, or you just don’t enter in round, you can pick cute sunflower for play. 

# Goals:
Add new plants what can give new scenario:
- add source of oil for botany
- add makeshift welding tool and source of fuel in case you can't get basic one.
- add new gost role for people who died and still want play.
- exclusive sunflower items can add more personality to each sunflower and allow them to help the station.

# Gameplay:

Basic sunflowers used to be source of oil, like in real life. Sunflowers will have to have 2 mutation ways. One is sentiflowers – sentient sunflowers, and meltingflower – a sunflower that can be used like makeshift welding tool and source of welding fuel.

Sentient sunflowers are used to be temporary replacement of crew members, and grass monkeys who do funny things. They have two arms for work, suit back slot for oxygen, belt for tools. Also have hat, suit, eyes, mask, ears slots. That enough to have a lot fun ways to play. In all slots except suit can be placed basic human stuff, in suit slot sunflowers get unique clothing’s and no one except sunflowers can wear this. So far, only the “Heliosphere” spacesuit is on this list. That spacesuit allows sunflowers work in space. And sunflowers now can be engineers and salvagers, or they can build own shuttle and explore space. Sunflowers will have the ability to create their own seeds. This will allow sunflowers to reproduce in a wider range of situations.

The event with the release of creatures from the ventilation can also create one intelligent sunflower in some part of the station. This will be a huge layer of different possible situations. It can get a job in some department, can grow its own kind in technical tunnels and create its own gang (I think for this it is worth adding the ability to create soil in which you can plant plants)

Meltingflower will be source of welding fuel in some cases like for perma prisoners. That will be good for future makeshift tools

# balance issue:
I understand problems with balance. In nuke botany can mobilize vegetation for fight. If they also get death nettle it will be an invincible army. For fight with that I give sunflowers clumsy trait, they can’t shoot. Also, they don’t have hardsuit’s from start, RND need research repley for suit blueprint, but in nuke scenario RND research weapons. Also, each Heliosphere costume cost lot resources. Made a lot depressurization can counter PMCs PETALS. As sunflowers have less health, they can’t live in vacuum so long as humans.
And I think about give sunflower’s zombie immune, for fighting against zombies. That converts space station 14 in literally Plant’s vs Zombies. We know a lot about EA, and we don’t want have a sue.

# xenoborgs:
The Xenoborg design document was approved. I immediately realized that sunflowers could fit in as one of the crew's tactics for replacing dead crew members in order to fight off robots. If a Xenoborg is destroyed, the crew will throw out its brain or just eat it. This means that there will be ghosts who died and want to come back, sunflowers can fulfill this request. It is much easier to make non-standard decisions during combat, knowing that if you die you do not have to wait an hour until the next round, you will simply be reborn through a sunflower.

In the realities for which they were balanced, where there were spiders, nuclear operatives and zombies as opponents of the station. To prevent sunflowers from steamrolling antagonists, they had a lot of weakening. Now I think the clumsiness trait should be removed, and also a new spacesuit for sunflowers "titanium petals" should be added to the third tier of the arsenal tech tree. This spacesuit will also be able to cover some of the sunflowers' weaknesses. You might say that this is too much. But I will answer that in a situation where there are enough people on the station who can shoot, no one will spend a lot of resources and time on printing spacesuits for weak sunflowers, they would rather make advanced weapons. If there is no one left to fight except sunflowers, then this spacesuit gives the crew the opportunity to comeback due to new forces.

# Inspirations:

- Plants vs Zombies
- Space station 13

# ToDo list
- Titanium petal hardsuit
- Ability sunflowers to create their own seeds
- Sunflower scrubber event
- The accent of sunflowers does not allow them to speak without cognizin. (Like monkeys)
- "No Borg Allowed" sign that can be carried in your hands and screwed to the floor
# Requirements:

Sunflower’s sprite design made to display what they have in hands; this is the reason why they look a little unsightly from the side. I appreciated if someone can resprite more… cute side sprites, we tried three times.
I understand how to make a sunflower be able to wear costumes only with a specific tag, but I don't understand how to make sure that everyone except sunflowers can't wear a suit with a tag “Sentiflower wearable”
I am not sure sentient sunflower prototype will work. I combine Diona proto and monkey proto. 

Also i think to add more stuff for sunflowers like new clothes
It good to make displacement map for sunflower, but i don't know how make it
