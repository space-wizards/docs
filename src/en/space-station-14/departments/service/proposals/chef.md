| Designers | Implemented | GitHub Links |
|---|---|---|
| Warpzoned | :warning: Partially | TBD |

## Overview

This proposal is a moderate expansion of the current cooking system, adding new machines, procedures, and ingredients.
<p>Microwaves have been made less redundant via the addition of new appliances, consequentially, new methods of cooking have been added.</p>
<p>Botany and Cargo possess new ingredients and orders respectfully for the Chef and the kitchen.

## Background

As it stands, the way food is prepared comes to be extremely lackluster and boring, due to the fact microwaves are the only widely utilized appliance since most recipes revolve around it - This document strives to address these issues by enriching Chef gameplay and the service department's in general.

# Appliances, Amenities, & Tables

This section will include the new machines and their purpose, the new kitchen amenities, as well as a table for each appliance and what they can cook.

## New Appliances

These will act as the microwave's substitutes, on-top of that, each has a different uniquely associated cooking speciality as a means to add more variety, meaning that there's a dedicated appliance for baking, but there's also another dedicated for frying, so on and so forth.

### Oven
- Works chronometrically, and if the dish stays in it for too long it turns into a burned mess.
- Has adjustable temperature to control how fast something cooks for.
- Used for baking a moderately wide selection of food.
- Post-EMAG proposal: If left turned on while empty, it will heat up the area around it to dangerously high temperatures.

### Stovetop
- Works chronometrically, however, dishes don't turn into a burned mess if not taken out in due time, the one exception to this being pancakes, as they require the pan to be flipped.
- Has adjustable temperature to control how fast something cooks for.
- Used mostly for boiling and brothy goods.
- Post-EMAG proposal: No effect.

### Deep Fryer
- Works chronometrically. 
- Has adjustable temperature to control how fast something fries for.
- Used for frying.
- Post-EMAG proposal: Turns into a knock-off crematorium, ashing every item thrown into it after a short duration.

### Ice Cream Maker
- Works chronometrically.
- Used exclusively for ice creams.
- Post-EMAG proposal: All subsequently made ice creams temporarily mute players upon consumption, cue brain freeze.

## Appliance Changes

Changes to existing appliances to better fit with the newly added ones.

### Grill
- Works chronometrically, and if the dish stays in it for too long it turns into a burned mess.
- Has adjustable temperature to control how fast something grills for.
- Used for grilling meat.
- Post-EMAG proposal: No effect.

### Microwave
- Works on a timer.
- Used for a select few instant recipes and donk pockets.
- Post-EMAG proposal: Same as previously.

# Procedures & Ingredients

This will include new ways to cook up existing dishes, as well as new ingredients and their sources.

## New Procedures

Procedures are, to put simply, the process that the ingredients go through in order to become a dish. I think introducing a relatively modular system like this to be entirely positive, as modularity is one of the things the kitchen is severely lacking, primarily due to nearly everything being based on fixed recipes.

### (3) Entr√©es
- **Breads** - You are now able to shape the dough into different formats with a rolling pin to obtain one of the listed types of bread, these being: Baguette, Boule, Bun, Flatbread, Pasta, Pie Cover, Pie Crust, Pizza, and White. Note that some doughs require added ingredients to be finalized.
- **Cheeses** - You are now able to use a cheese press in order to obtain whatever kind of cheese you so desire, these kinds being: Brie, Cheddar, Feta, Gouda, Mozzarela, and Swiss.
- **Soups** - Upon having a pot full of water, either add the listed recipe ingredients, or whichever others you prefer as soups also use a food sequence system.

### (9) Main Dishes
- **Burgers** - Burgers are now assembled outside any appliances with the use of the same food sequence system.
- **Chilis** - Throw in olive oil, onions, and beef, then whichever remaining ingredients listed on the recipe.
- **Kebabs** - Kebabs are now also assembled outside any appliances with the use of a food sequence system.
- **Pastas** - Upon the initial dough batch it must be cut into the desired pasta type, afterwards just add whichever ingredients the recipe lists.
- **Patties** - All burgers' dedicated meat, changes place with raw meats in the previous recipes, must be flipped with steel tongs.
- **Pizzas** - First comes the dough, then the tomato sauce & grated cheese, and lastly whichever added ingredients you so prefer using a food sequence system similar to that of burgers'. Can be cut into smaller portions once finished.
- **Pies** - Similar procedure to that of the pizzas', except with a differently shaped salted dough, upon filling up the interior with whichever ingredients the recipe lists you finish it off with an added sheet of pastry. Can be cut into smaller portions once finished.
- **Steaks** - Now grilled, has to be flipped with steel tongs.
- **Tacos** - Tacos are now also assembled outside any appliances with the use of a food sequence system.

### (3) Side Dishes
- **Boiled Rice** - First goes the pot, then goes the water, and lastly, the rice.
- **Fries** - Chop up the potato into strips, then chuck them onto the fryer, simple as.
- **Salads** - Salads are now also assembled outside appliances.

### (5) Desserts
- **Cakes** - Upon the initial mixture, you place the batch on a cooking tray, then after it's done baking you may add toppings up to your own discretion using a food sequence system. Can be cut into smaller portions once finished.
- **Cookies** - Similar procedure to that of the cakes', except that instead of the batch going immediately into a cooking tray, you first pick up small bits of the cookie batch as to place them individually.
- **Ice Creams** - Upon the listed mixture being complete and ready to eat, you may add toppings up to your own discretion using a food sequence system.
- **Pancakes** - Upon the initial mixture, pour the batch on a pan, afterwards, you must wait until it's ready to be flipped. Can be cut into smaller portions once finished.
- **Waffles** - Similar procedure to that of the pancakes', except that instead of the batch going into a pan it goes into the waffle maker, does not require flipping.

Note: The presented categorization has no in-game implications, it's just there as a way to guide the reader.

## New Ingredients

These were added not only as a means to increase immersion, but also as a push towards inter-departmental interaction.

- **Spinach** - Planted by Botany.
- **Lettuce** - Planted by Botany.
- **Olives** - Planted by Botany.
- **Olive Oil** - Used for cooking, as seasoning, or as a makeshift frying oil, obtained by either grinding up olives on a grinder, or by mushing them with a mortar & pestle.
- **Vegetable Oil** - Used to fry, obtained via Cargo.
- **Tomato Sauce** - Used in a wide selection of recipes, obtained by either grinding up tomatoes on a grinder, or by mushing them with a mortar & pestle.

# Other Content

Other additions that didn't quite fit into the previous categories.

## New Flavour Equipment

Gives more colour to the kitchen, and acts as an incentive for players to put more time into Chef.

- **Tall chef's hat** - Unlocked after having played Chef for a while.
- **Senior Chef Uniform** - Unlocked after having played Chef for a while.
- **Senior Chef PDA** - Unlocked after having played Chef for a while.
- **Itamae Hat** - Immediately available.
- **Itamae Uniform** - Immediately available.

## New Flavour Amenities

Similar reasoning as above, the kitchen is extremely bland from a decorative aspect, and so these additions were made in order to make it more visually appealing

- **Baker's Couche** - Special kind of table-cover, purely aesthethic.
- **Cutting Board** - Board to cut up various ingredients, just place them in there and chop-chop!
- **Ticked Holder** - A wall-mounted contraption used to hold Cargo's various bounties, as well as the hungry crew's requests.

## Mapping Changes

- The kitchen now also has a drain.
