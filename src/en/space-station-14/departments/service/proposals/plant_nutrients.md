## Overview

A rework of the potency, nutrient, water, and environmental tolerance mechanics of botany. Instead of having a potency value that decides the amount of reagents a plant generates, it will instead be decided by the amount of, and type of nutrients in the plant. More powerful reagents require nutrients that are harder to obtain, or have other downsides to their use. Some reagents will also change the environmental requirements of the plant that contains them, such as a cryogenics related reagent causing a plant to require colder temperatures to survive.

## Background

The current botany nutrient system is a nutrient ouroboros where you can infinitely feed a plant with its own products, and the only other resource used is infinitely generated by sinks.
Mass producing chemicals like omnizine is incredibly easy, as it uses the same resources that are needed to grow basic food plants like wheat.
If a botanist knows what they are doing, the potency of an unmutated plant will always be either 27-30, or 50.
Pest killer is useless, as the only way for a plant to gain pests is by adding chemicals to a plant that have no good reason to be added to plants.

## Features to be added

The basic water, nutrient, and potency values on plants are removed.

Reagents grown with plants now come with nutrient requirements, the more requirements are met, the more the plant makes.
Nutrient requirements are met by adding the nutrient to the plant via pouring a reagent that contains the nutrient into the tray/soil.

Some nutrients requirements can also be met more efficiently by gasses in the atmosphere.

Nutrients can be specific elements, like carbon or oxygen; or more vague categories, like flammable, cold, or clown-related.

If a plant has nutrients added to it that it can't use to make reagents, it loses health. Some nutrients (radioactive, toxic, etc.) deal more damage this way than others, some might not deal any damage. (nitrogen, water, etc)

Some nutrient types come with unwanted effects, even if the plant needs them to survive. For example, sugary nutrients increasing the amount of pests, or radioactive nutrients randomly mutating the plant.
Nutrient requirements are not always from the reagents in a plant. Plants with special properties (steelcaps, death nettles, etc.) can have extra requirements not related to their reagents.

Some reagents will also change the environmental tolerances, or other stats of the plant that makes them.

For example:
- Flammable reagents like welding fuel and oil could lower a plant's tolerance to high temperatures.
- Temperature-stablizing reagents like leporazine could raise a plant's tolerance to both high and low temperatures.
- Polypyrlium oligimers could lower the pressure requirement of a plant so much that it can survive in space, but no longer can survive earth-like air pressure.


## Game Design Rationale

The increased difficulty of making chemicals like omnizine encourages botanists to experiment and grow a variety of plants, instead of just mass producing omnizine, and whatever the chef asks for.

Carefully considering which plant you should grow based off of what nutrients you have access to is probably more fun than making a hyper-optimized omnizine or TDD plant, then not growing any other mutated plants.

Botanists can choose to take risks by growing more difficult plants, and are rewarded with better chemicals.

Consider addressing:
- How does the feature align with our [Core Design Principles](../space-station-14/core-design/design-principles.md) and game philosphy?
- What makes this feature enjoyable or rewarding for players?
- Does it introduce meaningful choices, risk vs. reward, or new strategies?
- How does it enhance player cooperation, competition, or emergent gameplay?

## Roundflow & Player interaction

Encourages botanists to interact with other departments to get new nutrients.

Cargo and salvage can provide raw materials to grind and use as nutrients, such as gold, uranium, plasma, and bananium.
Chefs can provide blood and uncooked animal protein from butchered animals.
Atmos can fill the botany room with gasses to provide nutrients.

Desired gameplay:
- A plant requires blood to create a reagent that the botanist wants, so they ask the chef to butcher an animal and give them a bucket of it's blood.
- The chef is out of monkey cubes, and the botanist does not have enough biomass to print one, so they go around the station asking people to donate blood to their plant.
- Nobody is willing to donate blood, so they grow blood tomatoes to convert water, nutriment, and iron into blood.

Undesired gameplay:
- A botanist creates a single plant containing all the reagents they need at the start of the shift, then spends the rest of the shift growing only that plant.

# Technical Considerations

Nutrient requirements and plant stat modifiers could be made a part of the SeedChemQuantity struct.

- Does the feature require new systems, UI elements, or refactors of existing ones? Give a short technical outline on how they will be implemented.
- Are there any anticipated performance impacts?
- For required UI elements, give a short description or a mockup of how they should look like (for example a radial menu, actions & alerts, navmaps, or other window types)
