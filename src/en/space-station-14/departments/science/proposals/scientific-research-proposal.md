## Problem statement
At present, the science department faces several key gameplay issues when it comes to unlocking items through scientific research. These include (but are not limited to):
-	A large number of research projects that can be considered ‘filler’. These projects unlock either very niche or commonplace items on the station; a choice between unlocking magboots, hydroponic trays, or buildable research disk terminals is not compelling for the player. 
-	A high proportion of 'filler' tech at lower research tiers leads to players considering such technologies merely as stepping stones towards some final project (typically a specific high-tier technology). This also means that useful low-tier technologies that belong to disciplines outside of their target are more likely to be overlooked during the early to mid-game stages of the shift when they would be most useful.
- Due to the abundance of low to mid-tier researchable items available on the station at round start, there is a limited need for other departments to request equipment from the science department
-	Many research items seem to be under costed with respect to the current ease of points generation. This leads to shifts where all research projects can be readily completed, particularly during longer than normal shifts and / or shifts that have a large research team.
-	Once all research projects have been completed, there is no longer any compelling reason to conduct any further research, leaving the department without any form of late-game content.

## Proposed changes
The changes to scientific research outlined in this proposal have been devised in an attempt to alleviate the issues listed above. These changes include:
-	Making all low-tier / filler researchable items available to print at round start at the protolathe and/or relevant techfabs. These include items such as proximity sensors, TV circuit boards, and surveillance camera equipment.
-	Making the more desirable mid-tier researchable items (e.g., lasers and high-capacity batteries) also available to print at round start, but with the caveat that research points are required as part of their construction. Lore-wise, this can be explained as the technology already being widely known, however, you need to purchase technology licenses from NT in order to print them. 
-	Scientists can print technology licenses from the tech disk terminal, exchanging their research points for discipline-specific licenses (e.g., a single civilian technology license might cost 150 research points, a single industrial technology license 250, and a single arsenal technology license 350).
-	These licenses can then be fed into (or ejected from) an appropriate lathe just like any other resource material (e.g., arsenal technology licenses can be inserted into security and ammo fabs, civilian technology licenses into medical fabs, and experimental technology licenses into protolathes).
-	Licensed items require a number of licenses that correspond to their relative power/usefulness (e.g., a laser carbine might require five licenses to print, in addition to their other base materials, while a box of incendiary ammunition might only need one license). 
-	The highest tier / most powerful technologies (e.g., bluespace backpacks, speed boots, teleporter pads. Perhaps a dozen technologies in all) would still need to be researched in a manner akin to the traditional way; first, a research project is selected on the R&D computer from a short list which is randomized each shift. After a research project is selected, any research points accumulated by crew members on the station will automatically count toward progressing that particular technology (these points are not consumed, however, and can be used for printing licenses as described above). Each of these research projects will require the crew to accumulate a vast amount of research points to unlock them, in the range of hundreds of thousands. The ultimate goal is that unlocking a new technology should be a relatively rare occurrence within the shift, with perhaps only two or three unlocks per shift being common. Once unlocked, the associated device can be printed at a lathe as normal (these will also requires licenses to print; unfortunately, NT owns all patentable technology produced by their staff).

## Benefits of the proposed changes
The proposed changes seek to shift scientific research from being a short-term and low-impact activity to a long-term goal for the shift, while still allowing the science department to outfit the crew with limited amounts of specialized high-tech equipment by exchanging their research points for technology licenses.

The benefits of this approach can be summarized as follows:
-	All filler research projects that attract little interest from players would be removed from the pool, allowing the research team to work directly towards the cooler, more impactful research projects.
-	Niche tools and items will always be available to the crew (the janitor can actually get an advanced mop when they ask for one), but these items still require research to obtain.
-	The total number of advanced items on the station can be controlled, to a degree, because there is a large research burden to produce them in bulk.
-	The smaller number of projects that can feasibly be completed in a shift means that the research project randomization has a greater impact on how the round plays, decisions on research direction become much more important, as well as giving a strong sense of satisfaction when a project is completed.
-	Even if the research team were somehow able to complete all research projects in a given shift, they remain incentivized to continue their research in the late game so that they can continue to produce new items for the crew (i.e., there is an ongoing research point sink).
