# Salvage Department Design Document

## Concept
The Salvage sub-department is a substantial part of the Supply department's resource generation, acting as the most economic way to provide large quantities of raw materials to the station that would otherwise be costly or difficult to acquire. It draws heavily from the traditional "sci-fi industrial materials-handling" aesthetics; mining valuable asteroids, breaking down structures into scrap, and dangerous zero-g work in space. Salvage should appeal to players who seek to min-max efficiency in their work, challenging players on how to generate as much value for the station as possible with the time and resources they have. While Salvage's theming and duties necessitate not working inside of the station proper, this should not translate into Salvage being fully independent or disappearing from the station (and therefore the round) for extended periods of time.

## Intended Experience
- Hard work is cool work; Salvage feels dangerous and has cool tools to show for it.
- *The* space-facing job; work is conducted on the outer rim of the station, in a hazardous environment.
- Hard work pays off; doing Salvage tasks takes weight off Cargo's shoulders, with a visible positive effect on the department.
- Efficiency feels powerful; moving fast to keep ahead of the resource drain curve is encouraged, while mistakes slow things down. It should feel good to make numbers go up.
- Mutual collaboration with the station; the department provides, and is provided to in return.
- PvE presesence; Salvage gameplay explores the PvE system as part of its gameplay loops. 
- Good for medium-and-up ranges of player experience.

## Responsibilities
- Salvage is very efficient at providing resources other departments can make use of. While Cargo should be able to function somewhat without Salvage, if Salvage does its job Cargo should feel free to spend their resources elsewhere.
- Salvage is a source of rare and unique equipment not available elsewhere, both to enhance their own job and for the station. 
- Salvage is given the equipment and opportunities to deal with situtations on the outside of the station and in nearby surrounding space.

## Desired Gameplay
- Effecting gathering of resources.
  - Salvage should have tools and mechanics that allows them to efficiently turn labor into resources; every single sheet of steel is the result of Salvage putting in manual effort, but the mechanics provide greater yield than other jobs.
- Work consists of dangerous conditions.
  - Salvage gameplay should feature hazards that Salvagers have to navigate around and be mindful of. This heightens the stakes of performing the work and works as a trade-off for the high rewards Salvage can provide to the station.
- The core gameplay loops are engaging.
  - By virtue of being on the edge of the station, Salvage has a lot of room to expand into various areas and mechanics. Care should be taken to not make mechanics redundant. 
- Becomes stronger via upgrades from other jobs.
  - Salvage base mechanics should hold up on its own, but when utilizing the output from other jobs Salvage should find itself enhanced even further. Note that this should not be in the form of Salvage gathering things from other jobs round-start to optimize its gameplay, but as a result of other jobs' progression paths.

## Undesired Gameplay
- Gameplay that encourage being away from the station for long periods of time.
  - This is not to say that Salvage can't make trips away from the station grid, but any such excursions should have the goal to return back to the station within a timely manner. I.e. a Salvager shouldn't feel encouraged to hop from off-station to off-station grid with activities to do at each location, but making Salvage retrieve resources from a single timed grid to the station could be a more viable gameplay loop. If Salvage is away from the station for too long they are failing to contribute to the station ecosystem and through a lack of interaction provide little impact to the overall round.
- Isolationism.
  - Related to the point above. As a resource generator Salvage will be in a natural position to utilize the resources, and Cargo provides further avenues to get equipment. Salvage should not be able to make efficient use of the materials they have when compared to other jobs.
  - When possible, harness the desire for progression to encourage interacting with complementary systems and induce collaborative gameplay with other departments. Implement feedback loops that encourage Salvage to collaborate with the station and not constantly hover on the outside.
- Tools and equipment that translate to high PvP potential.
  - While Salvage may have equipment that lets them handle harsh conditions and PvE elements, this equipment should not become too strong when brought onto the station or if Salvage is attacked by other players.
  - Similarly, Salvagers should not feel the need to use their Cargo connections to get strong PvP-viable weapons to perform their work efficiently. 
- Steamrolling resource generation.
  - The amount of resources Salvage is able to generate shouldn't be so massive as to completely invalidate resource management and regular Cargo gameplay tasks. At the same time, poor Salvage performance shouldn't be so debilitating that the rest of the station is unable to function. Salvage's impact should primarily be felt within Cargo; a great Salvage teams lets Cargo feel like it is flourishing, while a bad/non-existent Salvage team forces Cargo to allocate resources to getting materials via other means.
