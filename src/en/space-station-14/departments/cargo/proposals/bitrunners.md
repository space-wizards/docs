# Bitrunners

## Overview
This proposal introduces an abstract idea of another “robust job that kills fauna”, but one that is strongly station-based and safer compared to salvagers.

## Background
Upstream currently has problems with salvage. Big problems. Originally introduced as "guys that catch funny space fish and mine plasma ore", salvagers were distanced from the crew more and more with almost every change to salvage.
At the start there was a magnet, then a shuttle, then expeditions, then VGroid. Every change brought more content to salvage itself, but not to the station overall.
The main idea of bitrunners is to create "guys that catch funny space fish and mine plasma ore... OH FUCK, NEAR YOU!".

## Role gameplay

### So, they should be ported from TG?
TG bitrunners have a problem: they are boring. Let me be clear — the bitrunner loop on TG servers looks like this:
you choose a domain on the console in your department -> you lie in the capsule for the domain -> you get there -> you obtain weapons and kill fauna / do some other things to get a crate -> you return to the station.
There is basically no real "prize". You just kill fauna on another grid without any interaction. So bitrunning on TG is boring suffering for 1000 credits every 5 minutes.

### Alternatives?
My main idea for bitrunners is inspired by PJB's thoughts like "make them AR instead of VR". So bitrunners should walk around the station and search for **corrupted zones**.
Corrupted zones are small locations that can be spawned in random places on the station via a bitrunning console. They contain a bunch of hostile fauna and some cool resources, but are fully restricted to bitrunners and their equipment, so you just can't interact and even see them without bitrunner glasses.

### Equipment
Roundstart bitrunners need only three things to work:

- **Bitrunner glasses**, which allow bitrunners to see and interact with corrupted zones;

- **Bitrunner blaster**, which allows a bitrunner to kill fauna but is useless against everything else;

- **Bitrunning console**, which is used for spawning corrupted zones and connecting/disconnecting bitrunners.

### Zones
Every zone can be filled with many variations of entities: carps, snakes, VGroid stuff, mobs and structures from expeditions, maybe even argocites.
**Zone difficulty** and mob types will be visible before a bitrunner spawns a zone, so players won’t face goliaths at roundstart.

### Bitrunning points, progression
**Bitrunning points** allow bitrunners to unlock more dangerous corrupted zone types in their console, and also to buy bitrunning-related stuff like cool clothing, new weapons, and maybe something for fauna petting.
However, with every death (bitrunners can’t actually “die” from fauna because it’s kind of digital — they are just disconnected from the bitrunning vision), the bitrunner loses all their points.

This is not the only way to progress, though. **Science** can also give bitrunners cool upgrades such as weapon modules, armor, corrupted-zone locators, etc.
But bitrunners should still bring materials like uranium and diamonds from fauna to science for further research.
