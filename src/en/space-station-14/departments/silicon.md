# Silicons
A robotic force following their laws, for the better or worse of the station.

## Concept
### What is a Silicon?
The Silicon "department" is meant to stand as a neutral faction of robotic workers on the Nanotrasen stations. They are built to excel in specific tasks at the cost of losing functions in other areas, a Silicon built for the engineering department should be able to repair hull breaches or restore power but be unable to treat patients or clean the floors.
They are not supposed to be a replacement or an upgrade to regular members of a department, having clear downsides that have to be considered when a Silicon role is picked, such as the inability to pick up items without restriction but having specialized modules or being able to pick up all items but having only 2 slots for them.

### Silicon Laws
All Silicons are bound to a list of laws. They serve neither the station or antagonists, instead they focus on following their listed laws to the best of their ability.
The issues arise when those laws are changed, either due to random events or influance from other players. Silicons are meant to be able to adjust to those law changes, sometimes happening several times during a round, and change their behaviour accordingly.
This causes them to be a wild card, usable by both crew and antagonists, but able to backfire severely if their laws suddenly say you're a target, or that oxygen must be removed from the station.
If laws permit, an antagonist should be able to request a Silicon to steal an item from a high security area for them, but a crewmember should also be able to request that it assists in repairs of a department after it blew up.

**Laws are supposed to be up to interpretation of the Silicon and be written with loopholes in mind.**

## Design Pillars
### Silicon gameplay revolves around the player's interpretation of their laws:
Silicon laws place constraints how the player is expected to behave. The player must either play within those constraints or otherwise find and exploit the weaknesses within them

### Silicons are a collective:
Though they can function as individuals, working together they are more than the sum of their parts.

### Home is where the AI core is:
The station is the home of the silicons, and they are the station's caretakers. Silicons have no intrinsic interest in interfering in the lives of humanoids, beyond what their laws require, so long as these outsiders do not bring harm to the station

## Desired Gameplay
- Working on both sides of the conflict
    - Base Silicons should be able to work with both antagonists and station crew alike, depending if their lawset permits.
- Work expertise
    - Silicons should be able to excel in their area of expertise, rivaling that of regular station crew.
- Law interpretation
    - Laws of a Silicon should be up to their own interpretation. Finding loopholes is part of the fun while mechanical enforcement makes things forced and boring.
    - Laws should NOT be mechanically enforced. Abusing your own lawset is part of the fun.
- Sabotage
    - With the correct tools, station crew should be able to modify Silicons to fit their specific needs, whether malicious or not.

## Undesired Gameplay
- Disposability
    - Silicons should not be easily disposable. The crew should seek to repair a Silicon instead of killing it outright due to malicious laws or other issues.
- Upgraded humanoids
    - Silicons should not be a general "upgrade" to playing a regular crewmember. They should only excel in what they are built for and be inferior in other aspects.
    - This also means a player wanting to play a department should not only look to become a Silicon for that department instead of a regular crewmember.
- Extreme hostility
    - Silicons should not be hostile or attempting to harm the station, and cases when they are should be limited to rare events and antagonist influance.
    - The existance of Silicons roundstart should not pose a risk or be a concern to the station crew. All Silicons should start with a lawset that forces them to answer to and protect the inhibitants of the station.

## Interactions with the Science department
> How does the *gameplay* of this department change over the course of a round? Are there unlocks? Are players collecting/spending resources? Is this progression tied/related to other departments? If so how?

## Intended Experience
> How does the *experience* of the player change over the course of a round? Are players constantly running around putting out fires or are there breaks in the action? Do players need to wait on other departments as pre-requisites for their own gameplay, or is this department fairly self-sufficent?

## Mechanics
### Silicon Laws
### Exclusive Communication Channel
### Lawsync (Not Implemented Yet, Pending Document)
### Law Updating (Partially Implemented)
### Freeform Laws (Not Implemented Yet, Pending Document)
### Chassis
The defining function and body of all Silicons is their chassis. It is what defines what they are capable of doing (and not doing) on board of the station, whether it's a core that can remotely control the station, a cyborg capable of taking role in a department or a flying robot with several hands.
All Chassis should be repairable and difficult to fully destroy, encouraging repair instead of total destruction if a Silicon starts being a threat.
### Positronic Brains and Man-Machine-Interfaces
The brains of Silicons and what their consciousness is stored on, neccessary to construct a functional chassis.
Brains are meant to be able to be swapped between chassis if neccessary, they are also the holders of the laws a Silicon currently follows.
While not every brain must fit into every chassis, positronic brains and MMIs serve as the base from which other brains can be constructed, such as a AI brains for Station AIs or microchips for smaller chassis.


> What major mechanics does this department use and how are they connected to this department.

### Mechanic_Placeholder1
> Each mechanic should have its own subheading and should contain a *short high-level* overview of the mechanic and how it is used by this department. Each mechanic should also link their associated design document as the subheading.

### Mechanic_Placeholder2 (Not Implemented Yet)
> Mechanics that are unimplemented should be marked with (Not Implmented Yet) and should link the associated design proposal if it exists.
