## Overview

Add a combat system to perform combo attacks. 
If you are trained for a martial art that contains this combo, there will be a corresponding effect.

## Background

This proposal will be contextualized only with grab system. 
Martial arts can be a huge advantage in fight, so they will be avialible for syndies and very limited station workers. Also, this is a good way to add variety for syndies (and others, maybe).

## Combos

There are three unarmed attack types - Punch, Disarm and Grab. In certain sequences they can be a combo attack.
For example, CQC Kick is just two punches, but it allows combo performer to deal 10 brute and 45 stamina damage to lying person, and launch them forward.
If combo performer is NOT trained to the martial art - there will be no effect, because this is just two punches.

## CQC

CQC has 5 combos in total:

Slam: Grab -> Harm. Slams the target into the ground, paralyzing them for 12 seconds and dealing 10 brute damage, only if target was standing.
CQC Kick: Harm -> Harm. Kicks lying person and launches them one tile forward. Deals 10 brute and 45 stamina damage.
Restrain: Grab -> Grab. Stuns the target for 10 seconds and dealing 20 stamina damage.
Pressure: Disarm -> Grab. Deals 60 stamina damage.
Consecutive CQC: Disarm -> Disarm -> Harm. Deals 25 brute and 50 stamina damage.

CQC trained person starts their grab with Hard stage instead of Soft.
CQC trained person have 50% chance to steal a weapon from the opponent on disarm.

Chef can perform CQC combos while inside the kitchen, not everywhere.

Syndicate agents can buy CQC manual to learn this martial art and be able to use it everywhere and anytime.

Sleeping Carp Style has only 3 combos, but much passive abilities in total:

Crashing Wave Kick: Harm -> Disarm. Deals 15 brute damage and launches target forward.
