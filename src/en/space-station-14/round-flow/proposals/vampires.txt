# Overview
  Vampires are rarely attracted to the station as a way to increase their social standing in their organization. Draining blood and spreading their curse with the intent of raising to 
  the rank of King/Queen. While frowned upon, infighting and backstabbing is common in such conditions.
  As they gather blood and develop abilities, they will inevitably be disruptive to the station, eventually being hunted.

# Goals 
  They will always have 2 objectives
  -Become a King/Queen
  -Survive

# Vibes
  "They are nobles, treacherous selfish creatures by nature, reborn into decadence as they wish to forget their times of peasantry. Thoughts of plotting and acquisition always present, not even their won kings 
  be safe from their greed"
  This may change depending on how viable it actually is, but currently they are intended to be "competing" antag. There can only be a King/Queen, so its their choice if they wish to try to usurp their place.

  They dont wanna kill people if they can avoid it, as blood from dead creatures is way less efficient at sating their hunger.

# Vampire Ranks
  They possess a strong hierarchy, which allows them access to their abilities

  -King/Queen 
    Highest rank attainable in the station, the peak of their potential. Their rule often ended by the hands of their fellow vampires
    -access to all abilities
    -limited to 1 per station
    -station-wide announcement on its creation

  -Count/Countess
    Middle rank, granted to access to more lethal abiltiies. One step away from their goal
    -access to level 2 and below abilities

  -Baron/Baroness
    Lowest nobility rank, Vampires will spawn in this rank with mostly access to utility abilities
    -access to level 1 abilities

Ranking Up:
  Vampires will have to drain blood and infect X amount of people before they can perform a lenghtly do after to transform. Highly vulnerable during this state, it should only be done in secrecy

# Blood Drain
  Vampires can use this skill slowly drain blood from entities, receiving only half of it from dead entities. 
  If the drained entity blood is fully depleted, they will be stunned for about 20 seconds, giving the vampire a good chance to escape 

  This should ideally dicentivize vampires from outright killing people.

# Blood storage / Nutrition
  Vampires would have a big internal blood torage (maybe around 400u units) that would slowly deplete, this is their only worry in terms of nutrition.
  Similarly to how other species hunger works, Vampires walking speed is reduced when they are low on blood and they will quickly start taking damage if they are starving.

  Multiple abilities use this blood as fuel, so there's a risk to abusing them too much. 

# Ability Shop (i need to think of a better name)
    Vampires will have permanent access to an internal "store" menu (similar to syndies or wizards) which uses blood as a currency. The abilities they are able to buy from it depending
    on their rank. 
    While sticking to more classic vampire powers would be possible, i think streeching the definition a bit would allow for more interesting gameplay
    (Below is a list of possible abilities (numbers are examples, very in theory stuff))

    | Default abilities | All vampires start with access to these |
    |----------|:-------------|
    | Blood Drain | After a lenghty do after, the target is fully drained of their blood and is stunned for 10 seconds |
    | Bat Transformation | Quickly turn into a speedy bat or return back to your form. Being a bat prevents you from using your other abilities, and grants you access to a weak bite attack |
    | Unholy Sanctum | Curses a coffin, being inside it will quickly heal your damage. Using the ability again will perform a short do after and teleport you back to it | 1 minute cooldown | 

    | level 1 Abilities | Low cost abilities that while useful, lack the impact of the higher ranks |
    |----------|:-------------|

    | level 2 Abilities | Stronger yet more expensive, enough to make them a formidable threat |   
    |----------|:-------------|

    | level 3 Abilities | The peak of vampiric potential |   
    |----------|:-------------|

# Biology
    Traits (includes peasants)
    -Vampires go hungry much slower than regular crew, but they can only sustain themselves trough blood. Any other food will induce vomiting
    -They do not need to breath
    -Their bodies don't rot 
    -Small cold resistance 
    -Small fire vulnerability

  # Combat/Counters
      Vampires possess a slow constant regen and are highly resistant to being gibbed. To fully kill them, a crew member needs to perform a lenghty do after on the vampire body or heart
      with a sharp object.

      They possess several weaknesses common of the vampire trope 
      (big care will have to be placed on these to avoid metagaming)

      # Garlic 
        (they contain allicin)
        Vampires: 
        - Allicin acts as a slow poison to them
        - Garlic acts like glass shards, dealing a bit of holy damage and slipping the vampire if they are shoeless
        
      # Holy Water
        Vampires:
        -Vampires who have been splashed with holy water will have a temporary damage vulnerability, as it weakens their skin. If the holy water enters their body (likely from a spear or
        arrow, it will act like a poison)
        
      # Bible
        Vampires: 
        -The bible is incapable of healing them, as it will always deal damage instead.
        Crew:
