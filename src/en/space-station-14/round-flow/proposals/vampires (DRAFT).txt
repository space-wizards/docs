(Draft, still very very unfinished)
# Vampires
- major antagonist

# Overview
  Vampires are rarely attracted to the station as a way to increase their social standing in their organization. Draining blood and spreading their curse with the intent of raising to 
  the rank of King/Queen. While frowned upon, infighting and backstabbing is common in such conditions, as the honor of being the sole survivor is much higher than a collaborative effort.
  As they gather blood and develop abilities, they will inevitably be disruptive to the station, eventually being hunted.

# Goals 
  They will always have 2 objectives
  -Become a King/Queen
  -Survive

# Vibes
  "They are nobles, treacherous selfish creatures by nature, reborn into decadence as they wish to forget their times of peasantry. Thoughts of plotting and acquisition always present, not even their won kings be safe from their greed"
  This may change depending on how viable it actually is, but currently they are intended to be "competing" antag. As in their objectives are gonna crash and its their choice if they wanna risk their overall faction survival
  in exchange of more personal power. You are allowed to try and kill the current King/Queen to usurp their place.

# Vampire Ranks
  They possess a strong hierarchy, which allows them access to their abilities

  -King/Queen 
    Highest rank attainable in the station, the peak of their potential. Their rule often ended by the hands of their fellow vampires
    -access to all abilities
    -limited to 1 per station
    -station-wide announcement on its creation

  -Count/Countess
    Middle rank, granted to access to more lethal abiltiies. One step away from their goal
    -access to level 2 and below abilities

  -Baron/Baroness
    Lowest nobility rank, Vampires will spawn in this rank with mostly access to utility abilities
    -access to level 1 abilities

  -Peasant (basically thralls)
    Barely a vampire, mere mortals granted mercy from the curse at the cost of their freedom. Desperate to attain nobility
    -access to blood drain only
    -pacified towards higher rank vampires
    -they cannot spread the infection
    -easy to identify

Ranking Up:
  Vampires will have to drain blood and infect X amount of people before they can perform a lenghtly do after to transform. Highly vulnerable during this state, it should only be done in secrecy

# Vampire Curse
  The curse works like a disease and each vampire (excluding peasants) possesses their own unique strain of it, blood drain and multiple abilities will apply it to crew members.

  Effects: 
  -The curse is always lethal, it will very slowly deal unhealable damage. Consumption of holy water can help slow it down even further.
  -After enough time has passed, you will be able to tell when the vampire that infected you is nearby, this effect getting more intense and accurate as time passes, preventing vampires
   from hiding indefenetely
  -Infected and alive crew will passively grant bloodpoints to the specific vampire
  -The only way to remove the curse is by killing the vampire, any damage done by it quickly healing afterwards.
  -Entities cannot be infected by multiple curses. 
  -Vampires can see if an entity is infected by inspecting them at close range, they will be told if its their curse.

  -More effects may be developed if the vampire invests in their curse

# Bloodpoints
    Vampires can perform a lenghty do after on creatures with blood to fully drain them of it, granting them points which can be expended to unlock/upgrade abilities. This will stun the
    entity, allowing vampires a chance to get away. Though they will most likely require to crit or stun the creature beforehand.

    The amount of bloodpoints granted per unit of blood drained depend on the state and type of entity drained
    -Alive "humanlike" entity = %150
    -Dead "humanlike" entity = %75
    -Alive animal entity = %50
    -Dead animal entity = %20
    -Blood outside an entity (medbay bloodbags, puddles) = %5
    (amounts highly subject to change)

     This is intended to desentivize vampires from outright killing crew.

# Vampiric Energy
    Every vampire has a Vampiric Energy meter, which basically works like mana, passively regenerating and being consumed to use abilities. As they progress trough the ranks the max amount they can hold at a time increases.
      -King/Queen: 200
      -Count/Countess: 150
      -Baron/Baroness: 100
    It would be shown trough a small ui indicator on top of the health status. Most likely a red orb, similar to how diablo games show the player hp in vibes

# Ability Shop (i need to think of a better name)
    Vampires will have permanent access to an internal "store" menu (similar to syndies or wizards) which uses bloodpoints as currency. The abilities they are able to buy from it depending
    on their rank. 
    While sticking to more classic vampire powers would be possible, i think streeching the definition a bit would allow for more interesting gameplay
    (Below is a list of possible abilities (numbers are examples, very in theory stuff))

# Biology
    Traits (includes peasants)
    -Vampires go hungry much slower than regular crew, but they can only sustain themselves trough blood, which will always grant the same amount of substenance regardless of its origin. Any other food will inducing voimiting
    -They do not need to breath
    -Their bodies don't rot 
    -Small cold resistance 
    -Small fire vulnerability

    Their bodies develop helpful passives as their curses takes further hold of it 
    -King/Queen:       regen + %25 resistances buff + small speed buff + space immunity
    -Count/Countess:   regen + %15 resistances buff + small speed buff
    -Baron/Baroness:   regen + %10 resistances buff
    -Peasant:          regen (stops working when dead, no need to stab their heart)

  # Combat/Counters
      Vampires possess a slow constant regen and are highly resistant to being gibbed. To fully kill them, a crew member needs to perform a lenghty do after on the vampire body or heart
      with a sharp object.

      They possess several weaknesses common of the vampire trope 
      (big care will have to be placed on these to avoid metagaming)

      # Garlic 
        (they contain allicin)
        Vampires: 
        - Allicin acts as a slow poison to them, dealing bits of holy damage 
        - Garlic acts like glass shards, dealing a bit of holy damage and slipping the vampire if they are shoeless
        Crew:
        - Consuming allicin will decrease the speed at which the curse deals damage by a tiny bit
        
      # Holy Water
        Vampires:
        -Vampires who have been splashed with holy water will have a temporary damage vulnerability, as it weakens their skin. If the holy water enters their body (likely from a spear or
        arrow, it will act like a poison and deal holy damage)
        Crew:
        -Consuming holy water will drastically decrease the speed at which the curse deals damage
        
      # Bible
        Vampires: 
        -The bible is incapable of healing them, as it will always deal damage instead.
        Crew: 
        -The chap may use the bible to bless melee crew weapons, granting them +1 holy damage
        -The chap may use the bible to bless ammunition, granting it +0.5 holy damage
        (laser weapons cannot be blessed)

      (Holy damage is unaffected by resistances and can only be healed overtime or trough a few abilities. Making it a big threat to any vampire)
