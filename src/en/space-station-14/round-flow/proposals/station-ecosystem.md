## Overview

Life finds a way, and the station's minimalist ecology of fungi, vermin, and adapted plants are no exception. Such organisms are able to flourish in the dingy, humid, trash-ridden corners of the Maintenance Tunnels, and even develop unique ~~bacterial~~ cultures! While the Natural World provides an endless source of wonder for certain Scientists aboard, the stodgy Janitor (who has even more to clean) and Chef/Botanist (who find their products pilfered) might have a harder time appreciating the station's countless new friends. Let's just hope Urist McMaints makes a full recovery from that strange bite...

## Design Pillars
This idea ties in well with a few of SS14's design pillars:
- Chaos: If left unchecked, the ecosystem is free to mature, and critter populations may grow, mutate, evolve and run amok.
- Seriously Silly: "Yeah, Dave's not doing so hot. He got bit by something in maints, and he's a lot hairier than he was when he came in."
- Intuitive and Inter-Connected Simulation: An ecosystem presents many opportunities for player interaction, and could lead to some unlikely interdepartmental alliances.

## Ecology
The broad idea of station ecology is to expand the goings on of maintenance in a way that progresses naturally over the course of the round expanding upon the current random spawns of space shrooms and mice into something more interactive and consequential to round flow. 

### Food, Glorious Food
The following can provide a foundation for the station's food web:
- Plants e.g. Space Dandelions that have adapted to the low-light conditions of the Maintenance Tunnels
- Trash, including foods that have been discarded, or appropriated by some enterprising rodent
- Fungi and slime molds that feed on all of the above and below

Food ideally exists not only to serve as very mediocre sustenance but also to provide a source of resources, for ghetto chem or otherwise. 
These resources being tied to the natural continuous growth of life allows resources to be trickled into the round at a steady rate, or farmed by an enterprising crewmate.

### Critters Galore
With plenty to eat, these fuzzy friends should have no problem making a home for themselves:
- Mice and Rats
- Raccoons and Opossums
- Ian, bad dog! Get that out of your mouth this instant!

Critters act as the second stage of the ecosystem, feeding off of the "food" available and acting as vermin for the station. 
Their deaths can be the source of more resources, whether directly (i.e. a Space Racoon dropping valuable maints loot) or indirectly with the caracasses serving as food for the next generation of fungus or vermin. 

## Role Interactions
- Janitor: Will have more messes to clean, or else the ecosystem could spiral out of control. 
- Chef: May see a wider variety of ingredients coming to the kitchen (scurrying in on four legs, trying to steal-a da pizza!). With the right perspective, pathogens are just another seasoning!
- Botanist: May see a similar increase in hungry thieves. Could also gather wild plants and fungi for cultivation or otherwise.
- Doctor: May see an increase in the rate of bite- and scratch-type injuries. Maints ecology could also easily be a vector for diseases if those are to be added. 
- Chemist: The chemist may want to collect some rare or valuable chemicals from some of the plants growing in maintenace. 
- All: Ideally all of these roles will have a vested interest in the goings on of maintenance ecology for one reason or another, giving more justification for the average crewmember to interact with maintenance. 

## Notice of Shipment Rejection

Quartermaster's rejection reason: "Package manifest incorrect"

Notes: "Instead of thirty (30) sheets of plasma glass as indicated, crate contained one (1) rabid raccoon. Crate returned to sender."
