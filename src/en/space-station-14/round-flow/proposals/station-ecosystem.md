## Overview

Life finds a way, and the station's minimalist ecology of fungi, vermin, and adapted plants are no exception. Such organisms are able to flourish in the dingy, humid, trash-ridden corners of the Maintenance Tunnels, and even develop unique ~~bacterial~~ cultures! While the Natural World provides an endless source of wonder for certain Scientists aboard, the stodgy Janitor (who has even more to clean) and Chef/Botanist (who find their products pilfered) might have a harder time appreciating the station's countless new friends. Let's just hope Urist McMaints makes a full recovery from that strange bite...

## Design Pillars
This idea ties in well with a few of SS14's design pillars:
- Chaos: If left unchecked, the ecosystem is free to mature, and critter populations may grow, mutate, evolve and run amok.
- Seriously Silly: "Yeah, Dave's not doing so hot. He got bit by something in maints, and he's a lot hairier than he was when he came in."
- Intuitive and Inter-Connected Simulation: Simulation will be the main part of the ecosystem mechanic, and there is a challenge in keeping it intuitive. A simple start can provide a foundation for other contributors to build on. An ecosystem presents many opportunities for player interaction, and could lead to some unlikely interdepartmental alliances.

## Ecology
### Food, Glorious Food
The following can provide a foundation for the station's food web:
- Plants e.g. Space Dandelions that have adapted to the low-light conditions of the Maintenance Tunnels
- Trash, including foods that have been discarded, or appropriated by some enterprising rodent
- Fungi and slime molds that feed on all of the above

### Critters Galore
With plenty to eat, these fuzzy friends should have no problem making a home for themselves:
- Mice and Rats
- Raccoons and Opossums
- Ian, bad dog! Get that out of your mouth this instant!

### What's Our Vector, Victor?
Because what good are diseases with nothing to spread them? These little guys need to eat, too!
- Fleas
- Flies
- Mosquitoes

## Role Interactions
- Janitor: Will have more messes to clean, or else the ecosystem could spiral out of control.
- Chef: May see a wider variety of ingredients coming to the kitchen (scurrying in on four legs, trying to steal-a da pizza!). With the right perspective, pathogens are just another seasoning!
- Botanist: May see a similar increase in hungry thieves. Could also gather wild plants and fungi for cultivation or genetic study.
- Doctor: May see an increase in the rate of bite- and scratch-type injuries. May see new types of disease to treat.
- Geneticist/Virologist: These roles are currently not implemented, but the station ecosystem may provide a promising base for such studies.
- Pest Control/Exterminator: If Station Ecosystems really takes off as a gameplay mechanic, a dedicated role might make sense on larger maps.

## Notice of Shipment Rejection

Quartermaster's rejection reason: "Package manifest incorrect"

Notes: "Instead of thirty (30) sheets of plasma glass as indicated, crate contained one (1) rabid raccoon. Crate returned to sender."
