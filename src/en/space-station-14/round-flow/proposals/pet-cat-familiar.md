## Overview

This proposal describes the addition of a new cat familiar ghost role by re-using cat and syndicat assets.
In addition to re-using assets, a few mechanics and gameplay features are to be introduced to make the ghost role dynamic, interactive and fun.

## Reason for proposal

There are a lot of ghost roles in the game already, but the issues ususally involve how much one can do with those roles to still have fun in the game.
Many times mice or any station pets only involve walking around and just observing the station as a whole, which may come off as a bit boring when there is not much interactivity given to their circumstances.
To combat this boredom issue, pet cats are introduced as a familiar to add a bit more complexity to the gameplay than just spectating as an animal with not much purpose given.

## How to include the pet cat in the game

The mentioned cats can be summoned by using a teleporter item like that of a syndicat's, except that the teleporter becomes an obtainable item by being included in the maint's random loot pool.
Using the teleporter prompts to name the cat that is about to be summoned.
The ghost role becomes available after the prompt for someone to take.

## Features

- The sprite of the cat is randomized and can be any of the existing ones (excluding syndicat)
- The player who plays the cat will see an icon on the person who summoned him, so they can be correctly identified as their owner
- Pet cats have an additional bag slot, which can hold a satchel bag (The sprite will show the satchel being strapped to its tail)
- The cat is not capable of speech, thus making only cat noises when the player types a message into the in game chat (just like syndicat)
- An additional "hand" slot is given to the cat for carrying items in its mouth
- Cats get access to basic (or emergency accessed) doors, so they do not become stuck in one room easily
- When the owner whistles from within anywhere in the station, the player who plays the cat will hear the whistle sound and get a pin pointer on the screen - The pointer points towards the owner as an indication for the cat to walk to them
- Cats are familiars and must follow their owner's orders or wishes
