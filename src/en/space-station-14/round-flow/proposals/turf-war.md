## Abstract

Turf war is a sub-gamemode that can be present in others (traitor, revolution; similar to thief).

Players must use spray painters to tag up turf for their respective departments. Whichever department gets the most doors sprayed at the end wins!

## Goals

It is intended to be a small bit of fun seen in some rounds, but not completely taking it over the round like revolution.

Turf taggers must **not** be selected from other antagonists in the round (could be exclusive with traitor, to keep it as a nonantag side fun gamemode.

Unlike most gamemodes, players selected can be in command and sec (since they aren't antagonists).

However, command staff will tag for their respective departments **and not command doors**. Since cap and hop don't govern individual departments, they can't be picked.

## Gameplay

Players are not antagonists (unless they are from another role) so they should not immediately start killing everyone, following escallation rules.

Naturally there will be skirmishes but it won't be as bloody as traitor assassinations or revolutions.

Each turf tagger has an objective to spray the most doors, which is either 100% (you are winning) or a % of whoever is winning.

On round end the number of doors each turf tagger has is shown, in order of who got the most.

Only one tagger is selected from each department at most, but they may recruit coworkers IC (not a flash) to join the turf war. Spray painters are available in YouTools so nobody is left out.


## Inspirations

TG families or whatever its called now, but with spraying doors.
