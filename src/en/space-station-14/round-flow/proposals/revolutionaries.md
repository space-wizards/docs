## Overview

As we have discussed in the [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/310555209753690112/311537926376783886/1258727306889793666) (where this was given *great* feedback), the Revolutionaries gamemode is currently in a state of limbo; often criticized as the worst gamemode by some due to the issues of power-gaming and meta-gaming that are involved, while others consider it one of the best gamemodes because of the fun and stories it can produce. This proposal aims to address the challenges related to meta-gaming and power-gaming, while also enhancing the overall enjoyment of the Revolutionaries gamemode.

## Conversion Rework:

- Instead of flashes, **Head Revolutionaries** are given a new action (like screaming, toggling harm mode) that will "spread propaganda" to everyone in a four-tile radius around them.
- Everyone has a hidden **Conversion Bar**. Once this bar is filled, one of two things will happen:
  1. **If the person IS NOT mindshielded**, they will be converted into a **Revolutionary**.
  2. **If the person IS mindshielded**, they will be notified of the spreading of **Revolutionary** propaganda.
- Posters and/or banners created by these **Head Revolutionaries** may also be used to fill the **Conversion Bar** (this only affects the player the first time it is interacted with).
- If a **Head Revolutionary** dies, all those who were converted by them will retain their **Revolutionary** status to prevent **Security** from only going after the **Head Revolutionaries**.

## Revolutionary Objectives:

- Instead of all **Revolutionaries** having the united goal of eliminating or restraining all **members of Command**, they may now have separate goals.
- **PERSON SPECIFIC** examples of what some may be:
  - *Ensure that [head of department] is eliminated.*
  - *Convert at least [%] of [department that isn't Security].*
  - *Steal the [high-value station item].*
  - *Ensure that [person, IS mindshielded] is converted.*
  - *Ensure that [person, IS NOT mindshielded] is converted.*
  - *Convert at least [%] of the station.*
- **GLOBAL** examples would be:
  - *Ensure that the Captain of the station is eliminated.*
  - *Survive until the end of the shift.*
- Whenever a **Revolutionary** is converted, they will inherit the objective to ensure that the **Head Revolutionary** that converted them has all their own objectives completed.
- These objectives also mean that different **Head Revolutionaries** may have conflicting end-goals.

## Possible Ideas:

- **Head Revolutionaries** are no longer known to other **Head Revolutionaries** (perhaps they could be given a codeword system?).
- **Revolutionaries** are no longer known to other **Revolutionaries**, except by the **Head Revolutionary** who converted them.

## Other:

- Pros:
  1. Flashes can no longer be meta-gamed.
  2. **Revolutions** are now much quieter than before, as well as being far less lethal.
  3. Some **Head Revolutionaries** cannot work together to complete conflicting objectives.
  4. Multiple players can be converted into a **Revolutionary** at once.
  5. There are now possibilities of "Departmental **Revolutions**" instead of stationwide **Revolutions**.
  6. The crew now have ways to sniff out or suspect a **Revolution** without meta-gaming.
  7. There is now much more RP opportunity in the process of turning into a **Revolutionary**.

- Cons:
  1. Posters and banners can be somewhat used to metagame the existance of a **Revolution**.
  2. Some players may intentionally seek out these posters and banners to antag-roll.
  3. Converting players into **Revolutionaries** is a more time-consuming process.
  4. Glasses no longer protect against conversion into a **Revolutionary**.
  5. Converted **Revolutionaries** no longer know the identities of other **Revolutionaries**.
