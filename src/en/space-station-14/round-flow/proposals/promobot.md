## Overview

A minor (solo?/team?) "antagonist" which seeks to improve Nanotransen's public image through sheer volume of promotion. Make doors announce "This opening was sponsored by Nanotransen!" Force security to proclaim their love of Donk Pockets to activate their stun batons! Add pop-up ads to maps! All in the name of ensuring everyone knows just who put them on this floating deathtrap!

## Background

One issue with mid-round events at the moment is the lack of variety; there's only so many times space adders can spawn in the vents before the question of how an entire zoo got shipped onto the station arises. While one event won't solve the issue, it'll help a little.

In addition, many ghost roles at the moment are either pure free agents with no in-game goal (skeletons, most pests), or just exist to kill things (spiders). A new antag that disrupts the station without killing anyone will add variety to gameplay.

<s>Also, I'm an evil monster who needs to be stopped.</s>

## Core Gameplay

The promobot is a type of borg which modifies devices around the station to spread positive awareness of Nanotransen. Like any borg, the promobot will have the three default crewsimov laws, with the additional fourth law, "Not being aware of and/or in love with Nanotransen harms crew, and is the worst kind of harm they can suffer."

The promobot will have many different effects it can induce in devices, but it will need to unlock the more powerful ones by using the minor effects on many devices and having people drigger them (to show Nanotransen that it is worth investing more resources into the bot). In this way, the promobot would build in disruptiveness over time. Initial effects would be minor and mostly serve to bring awareness of the bot's existence, while later ones would be much more annoying and take more work to deal with. The bot could have some kind of final "ultimate ability" that causes a massive, catastrophic issue, but I'm not sure it's neccesary; it should be annoying enough on its own to incentivize the crew to deal with it. 

# Design Pillars

## Just a Spark

The crew's interaction and response to the promobot forms the core of its gameplay. Do they ignore it until it becomes such a massive problem the shuttle has to be called (after watching a 15 second ad, of course)? Do they hunt it down at the first sign of its existence? Do they agree to sing the praises of Nanotransen in the hopes the bot will be appeased and stop messing with stuff? It's all up to the crew and bot to form the narrative.
  
## Escalation

The promobot will gradually build in disruptiveness as it spreads the word of Nanotransen. This will allow the crew time to respond to it before it completely wrecks everything on the station.
  
## Full time job

The bot has a built-in incentive to mess with normal station proceedings. Even if the crew decides to "play nice," the bot shouldn't ever stop causing some kind of problem.
  
## Back and Forth

Team Version:
Assuming all out war, both sides have multiple stages between a total victory and a total defeat. For the crew, the destruction of a promobot weakens the influence of the bot team and serves as a step toward wiping them out. For the bots, they would constantly be working towards more powerful options, with infecting major devices serving as a minor victory.
  
## Discoverability

A promobot infestation should quickly make itself apparent, and the simplest form of counterplay (kill 'em) is self explanatory. More creative options, like worshipping Nanotransen to calm it down, can also be found by players who pay attention.
  
## Accessibility

The core gameplay of a promobot should be simple enough that a player can figure it out based on the ghost-role description, in-game tooltips, and the borg laws.
  
## Fun to lose against (or as)

- Losing/dying to an antag should not feel unfair to a player. Players should always have some option in terms of counterplay. The same goes for antags, they should always feel like they have options and are not hard countered.
