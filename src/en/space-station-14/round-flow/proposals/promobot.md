## Overview

A minor team "antagonist" which seeks to improve Nanotransen's public image through sheer volume of promotion. Make doors announce, "This opening was sponsored by Nanotransen!" Force security to proclaim their love of Donk Pockets to activate their stun batons! Add pop-up ads to maps! All in the name of ensuring everyone knows just who put them on this floating deathtrap!

## Background

One issue with mid-round events at the moment is the lack of variety; there's only so many times space adders can spawn in the vents before the question of how an entire zoo got shipped onto the station arises. While one event won't solve the issue, it'll help a little.

In addition, many ghost roles at the moment are either pure free agents with no in-game goal (skeletons, most pests), or just exist to kill things (spiders). A new antag that disrupts the station without killing anyone will add variety to gameplay.

## Core Gameplay

A promobot is a type of borg which modifies devices around the station to spread positive awareness of Nanotransen, often to the detriment of their original function. The promobot will have the three default crewsimov laws, along with an additional fourth law: "Not being aware of and/or in love with Nanotransen harms crew, and is the worst kind of harm they can suffer."

Promobots activate as a random event, spawning in vending machines around the station. They will remain inactive and undetectable until a ghost controls them, at which point they'll exit the vending machine and be free to move around. They will be small, like mice, and able to run under doors and tables.

The promobots will have many different effects they can induce in devices, but will need to unlock the more powerful ones by using the minor effects and having people trigger them (to show Nanotransen that it is worth investing more resources into the ad campaign). In this way, the promobots would build in disruptiveness over time. Initial effects would be minor and mostly serve to bring awareness to the bots' existence, while later ones would be much more annoying and take more work to deal with. Balance wise, unlocking the stronger effects will function as a bot "victory," meaning it won't happen every game and will require skill to achieve. 

Effect removal could occur over time, or need to be done manually by crew (probably engineering?). The manual removal would create more intermixing between crew, but I'm not sure the best way for it to happen since creating an entire item specifically for one antag feels odd.

The bots could also have some kind of final "ultimate ability" that causes a massive, catastrophic issue (infecting the AI?), but I'm not sure it's neccesary; they should be annoying enough on their own to incentivize the crew to deal with them, and they shouldn't be able to completely mess up the station unless the bots are very clever and the crew is very negligent.

### Effects
- Cause usable devices (doors, medical scanners, etc) to make pro-nanotransen announcements when used.
- Add pop-up ads to devices with screens/huds.
- Occasionally cause borgs to make pro-nanotransen statements instead of what they meant to say.
- Cause useable devices to become inoperable until the user states a given pro-nanotransen word/phrase.
- Cause doors to bolt shut until someone nearby states a given pro-nanotransen phrase.
- Add unskippable ads to devices with screens/huds.
- For devices with access to radio channels (intercoms, earpieces), cause pro-nanotransen announcements to occasionally be made over coms.

# Design Pillars

## Just a Spark

The crew's interactions with and response to the promobots form the core of their gameplay. Does the crew ignore them until they becomes such a massive problem the shuttle has to be called (after watching a 15 second ad, of course)? Do they hunt them down at the first sign of their existence? Do they agree to sing the praises of Nanotransen in the hopes the bots will be appeased and stop messing with stuff? It's all up to the crew and bots to form the narrative.
  
## Escalation

The promobots will gradually build in disruptiveness as they spread the word of Nanotransen. This will allow the crew time to respond to them before they completely infect everything on the station.
  
## Full time job

The bots have a built-in incentive to mess with normal station proceedings. Even if the crew decides to "play nice," the bots shouldn't ever stop causing some kind of problem.
  
## Back and Forth

Assuming all out war, both sides have multiple stages between a total victory and a total defeat. For the crew, the destruction of a promobot weakens the influence of the bot team and serves as a step toward wiping them out. For the bots, they would constantly be working towards more powerful options, with infecting major devices serving as a short-term victory.
  
## Discoverability

A promobot infestation should quickly make itself apparent, and the simplest form of counterplay (kill 'em) is self explanatory. More creative options, like worshipping Nanotransen to calm them down, can also be found by players who pay attention.
  
## Accessibility

The core gameplay of a promobot should be simple enough that a player can figure it out based on the ghost-role description, in-game tooltips, and the borg laws.
  
## Fun to lose against (or as)

For the bots, much of the fun comes from the risk/reward nature of their gameplay. They want to infect high-use devices in order to trigger more ads and build up faster, but that naturally means making risky moves against targets that will have a lot of people around them. A bot dying will often be the result of a misplay or taking a risk that doesn't work out, both of which put control in the hands of the player.

For most of the crew, the dynamic will be similar to service vs. mice; the bots are a minor nuisance most of the time and can be quickly killed if they get cocky, and the only way they can mess with something important and get away with it is if the device is left alone. Players can choose to try to organize a hunting party as well, which creates many opportunities for roleplay and creativity in how to go about it.

Also, the bots provide a lot of roleplay potential no matter what happens, which can be fun.

# Balancing Levers

Based on feedback, there are many things that could be changed to affect the game balance.

- Increasing/decreasing speed.
- Increasing/decreasing how many spawn.
- Adding armor.
- Allowing promobots to spawn more of themselves at vending machines on a team-wide timer.
- Increasing/decreasing how many ads need to trigger before more powerful effects are unlocked.
- Making effects wear off faster/slower.

# Alternative: Simple Promobots
Another option would be promobots that don't have any kind of buildup, don't have access to any truly disruptive abilities (just adding announcements to devices), and mostly exist as a way to create roleplay opportunities. They'd be more like a pest in this version; a small ghost role that doesn't have a lot of impact on the round, just running around the station and messing with stuff.
