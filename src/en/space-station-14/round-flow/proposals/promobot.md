## Overview

A minor ghost role which seeks to improve Nanotransen's public image through sheer volume of promotion.

## Background

One issue with mid-round events at the moment is the lack of variety; there's only so many times space adders can spawn in the vents before the question of how an entire zoo got shipped onto the station arises. While one event won't solve the issue, it'll help a little.

In addition, many ghost roles at the moment are either pure free agents with no in-game goal (skeletons, most pests), or just exist to kill things (spiders). A new role that has built-in roleplay potential would add to gameplay variety.

## Core Gameplay

A promobot is a type of borg which modifies devices around the station to spread positive awareness of Nanotransen. The promobot will have the three default crewsimov laws, along with an additional 0th law: "Not being aware of and/or in love with Nanotransen harms crew, and is the worst kind of harm they can suffer."

Promobots activate as a random event, spawning in vending machines around the station. They will remain inactive and undetectable until a ghost controls them, at which point they'll exit the vending machine and be free to move around. They will be small, like mice, and able to run under doors and tables.

Bots will have the ability to activate speakers inside usable devices (doors, medical scanners, etc), causing them to make pro-nanotransen announcements on use. For example, a stun baton would say "This justified brutality brought to you by Nanotransen!" when it is activated.
