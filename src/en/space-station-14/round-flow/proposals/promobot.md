## Overview

A minor solo antagonist which seeks to improve Nanotransen's public image through sheer volume of promotion. Make doors announce "This opening was sponsored by Nanotransen!" Force security to proclaim their love of Donk Pockets to activate their stun batons! Add pop-up ads to maps! All in the name of ensuring everyone knows just who put them on this floating deathtrap!

## Background

I'm an evil monster who needs to be stopped.

## Core Gameplay

The promobot is a type of borg which modifies devices around the station to spread positive awareness of Nanotransen. Like any borg, the promobot will have the three default crewsimov laws, with the additional fourth law "Not being aware of and/or in love with Nanotransen harms crew, and is the worst kind of harm they can suffer."

The promobot will have many different effects it can induce in devices, but it will need to unlock the more powerful ones by using the minor effects on many devices (to show Nanotransen than it is worth investing more resources into the bot). In this way, the promobot would build in disruptiveness over time. Initial effects would be minor and mostly serve to bring awareness of the bot's existence, while later ones would be much more annoying and take more work to deal with. The bot could have some kind of final "ultimate ability" that causes a massive, catastrophic issue, but I'm not sure it's neccesary; it should be annoying enough on its own to incentivize the crew to deal with it. 

# Design Pillars

## Just a Spark

The crew's interaction and response to the promobot forms the core of its gameplay. Do they ignore it until it becomes such a massive problem the shuttle has to be called (after watching a 15 second ad, of course)? Do they hunt it down at the first sign of its existence? Do they agree to sing the praises of Nanotransen in the hopes the bot will be appeased and stop messing with stuff? It's all up to the crew and bot to form the narrative.
  
## Escalation

The promobot will gradually build in disruptiveness as it spreads the word of Nanotransen. This will allow the crew time to respond to it before it completely wrecks everything on the station.
  
## Full time job

The bot has a built-in incentive to mess with normal station proceedings. Even if the crew decides to "play nice," the bot shouldn't ever stop causing some kind of problem.
  
## Back and Forth

- Success or failure shouldnâ€™t depend on a single event, rather there should be minor wins and losses over the course of a round that add up to the final climax.
  
## Discoverability

- There should be clear breadcrumbs present to provide clues to which antagonists are present. The crew should also be aware of their counterplay options to prevent antagonists from easily snowballing.
  
## Accessibility

- Antags should be provided with all the information required to perform their role, along with what they are allowed and not allowed to do to achieve their objectives. Mechanics/identification should not rely solely on colors for differentiation or functionality.
  
## Fun to lose against (or as)

- Losing/dying to an antag should not feel unfair to a player. Players should always have some option in terms of counterplay. The same goes for antags, they should always feel like they have options and are not hard countered.
