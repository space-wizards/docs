# Round Start Player Equipment

## Overview

This document section provides a general outline for what types of items are expected to be available to crew at the start of the round, segmented by the locations where the gear is found.

This document follows the decision made in [Maintainer Meeting (27 September 2025)](https://hedgedoc.spacestation14.com/Wtd4OwYZThqutLbR3y-e4g). There have been many PRs attempting to change what players get on round start. Round start equipment affects every round, so definitions need to be established for where players get what equipment. This way maintainers have a firmer base for evaluating these PRs.

## Forward
 
There's five main locations crew can obtain job equipment. The items they spawn with in their [Loadout](starting-equipment/loadouts.md), the items that spawn in [Department Lockers](starting-equipment/lockers.md), items available in [Department Vending Machines](starting-equipment/vendors.md), items printed from [Lathes](starting-equipment/lathes.md), and items [Mapped](starting-equipment/mapped.md) by the map creator.

Of these only the loadout is unavailable for mid-round players receiving a promotion or looking to steal gear. Therefore important items and necessary job equipment should **not** be given in loadouts. This pushes players to visit their department to collect the gear needed to properly do their jobs, thereby connecting them to their department and to their coworkers before they start working in earnest. 

Job-essential equipment is found in job lockers located within departments and staff rooms. Additional important items - mainly expendable and optional gear - can be obtained in vending machines. Suplimental tools and materials can be aquired from lathes or found mapped around the department.
