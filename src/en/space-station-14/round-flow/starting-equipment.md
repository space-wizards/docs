# Round Start Player Equipment

There are many locations where players can receive gear and equipment for their job at the start of a round, or mid-round via promotion. This document outlines those various locations and what items are expected to be available to players in those locations. Written following the decision in [Maintainer Meeting (27 September 2025)](https://hedgedoc.spacestation14.com/Wtd4OwYZThqutLbR3y-e4g).


## Loadout
Players spawn with these items, and possibly can choose between a small set of options. These items are generally cosmetic.

Players should spawn with department-identifying clothing. Players should not spawn with job-essential equipment. Late-join and promoted players are expected to visit their department to collect the gear needed to properly do their job.

**Good:**
 - Jumpsuit
 - Hardhat
 - Sterile mask

**Bad:**
 - Toolbelt
 - Insulated gloves
 - Rollerbed

Question: Should gloves in loadouts in general be replaced with fingerless versions? Gloves are widely available in many places, and starting with real gloves removes intentionality from antags trying to hide their prints.

## Lockers
Players spawn near these, and spend a few moments getting dressed and preparing for the shift. Lockers are intended to contain everything a player needs to do their job to a reasonable degree. Maps should have more lockers than job spawns.

Department lockers should spawn with job-essential equipment. A player should generally want most items in the locker, or be able to conceive a situation where they would want them. Lockers should not spawn with cosmetic items or expendable equipment that another member of the department might want to raid.

**Good:**
 - Toolbelt
 - Hardsuit
 - Disabler

**Bad:**
 - Compressed matter
 - Jumpsuit
 - Beer bottle


## Vendors
These spawn in departments, and players can visit them to share additional gear. Departments typically have two types of vendors: equipment vendors and clothing vendors. They can be restocked through a purchase from cargo mid-round.

Equipment vendors should spawn with expendable equipment, spare tools, and optional tools. They should not spawn with non-department gear or gear that is easily available (such as in an autolathe).

**Good:**
 - Medical topicals
 - Riot shield
 - RCD

**Bad:**
 - Flashlight
 - Hand labeler
 - Welding mask

Clothing vendors should spawn with equipable items typical of a department's colors or aesthetic qualities. Items should reflect the standard uniform of a department employee at round start.

**Good:**
 - Jumpsuit
 - Hardhat
 - Jackboots

**Bad:**
 - Any item that can't be equipped.
 - High-power items (hardsuits).

Question: Should eyewear in general and insuls specifically be moved to the drobe?

## Lathe
Most departments can print additional gear from a machine using shared resources. Some have an autolathe to print spare gear, while others have department-specific lathes for this purpose.

Items available to be printed round start from lathes might be tools or expendables. In both cases the options available should be the basic, minimum gear to do the job. Better gear is often available later in the round as a result of science research.

**Good:**
 - MV Cable
 - Toolbelt (and tools)
 - Syringe

**Bad:**
 - RCD
 - Grenade
 - Grappling gun
 
 
## Mapped
Some tools or materials might be laid out around the department for players to share. These items should be handled with a spawner to control and standardize their use through YAML.

Mapped items are shared department resources that every player has access to, and which a command member might try to ration. They are often consumable materials but can also include spare equipment.

**Good:**
 - Glass
 - Handcuffs
 - Banana peel

**Bad:**
 - Powerful tools otherwise unavailable round start.
