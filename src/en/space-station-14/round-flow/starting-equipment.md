# Round Start Player Equipment

## Overview

This section provides a general outline for what types of items are expected to be available to players at the start of their shift. It's particularly concerned with tools needed for regular station jobs.

This follows the decision made in [Maintainer Meeting (27 September 2025)](../../maintainer-meetings/maintainer-meeting-2025-09-27.md). In summary, PRs changing round start equipment are very common and represent a high workload due to subjective and unclear definitions of what should be available. Round start equipment affects every round, so definitions need to be established for where players get what equipment.

## Forward

There's five main locations where crew can obtain equipment for their role. The items they spawn with in their [Loadout](starting-equipment/loadouts.md), the items that spawn in [Job Lockers](starting-equipment/lockers.md), items available in [Department Vending Machines](starting-equipment/vendors.md), items printed from [Lathes](starting-equipment/lathes.md), and items [Mapped](starting-equipment/mapped.md) by the map creator.

Of these, only the loadout is unavailable for mid-round players receiving a promotion or looking to steal gear. Therefore important items and essential job equipment should **not** be given in loadouts. This pushes players to visit their department to collect the gear needed to properly do their jobs, connecting them to their department and to their coworkers before they start working in earnest.

## Definitions

### Essential Equipment
A role's esssential equipment are tools which have an irreplaceable function, and can be recognized as thematically "belonging" to the role. A Research Director's stamp is essential equipment because it plays an irreplaceable RP function, and has the role's name on it. Epinephrine, a stun baton, the nuke disk, or a bike horn are examples of essential items. These are consequently the items least likely to be in the hands of a different role, and most likely for an antagonist to want to steal. Essential equipment is often department contraband.

Sometimes essential equipment is a set of several items at once, such a a toolbelt or a foolbox. A t-ray is too common to be considered thematic, but a belt filled with a tool for every situation is thematic for engineers.

### Optional Equipment
Optional equipment are items that serve a rare or replaceable function, or aren't clearly suited for the role. Often this items are possesed by multiple roles or are easily crafted/found. The CMO's beret is optional because while it has the role's name on it, it doesn't do anything. A ballistic shield is thematic and useful, but only rarely useful. Hand labelers, generic flashlights, or RP props (cigar case) are examples of optional equipment.

### Expendable Equipment
Rather self explanatory: Expendable equipment is finite. It's something you need either time or resources to replace. They're often essential equipment by being highly specialized to a role.

## Pillars

### Pillar 1 - Always Available
Derived from "Mechanics cannot [...] require items that cannot be obtained after roundstart," in ([dynamic-environment](../core-design/design-principles.md)), truly unique items must be available in round regardless of player spawns. Essential equipment of the job should also be available regardless of players.

### Pillar 3 - Replaceable
No matter how valuable or limited, you can always replace a lost or missing tool.
