# Round Start Player Equipment

## Overview

This section provides a general outline for what types of items are expected to be available to players at the start of their shift. It's particularly concerned with tools needed for regular station jobs.

This follows the decision made in [Maintainer Meeting (27 September 2025)](https://hedgedoc.spacestation14.com/Wtd4OwYZThqutLbR3y-e4g#Roundstart-Locker-and-Vendor-Equipment-ArtisticRoomba). In summary, PRs changing round start equipment are very common and represent a high workload due to subjective and unclear definitions of what should be available. Round start equipment affects every round, so definitions need to be established for where players get what equipment.

## Forward

There's five main locations where crew can obtain equipment for their role. The items they spawn with in their [Loadout](starting-equipment/loadouts.md), the items that spawn in [Job Lockers](starting-equipment/lockers.md), items available in [Department Vending Machines](starting-equipment/vendors.md), items printed from [Lathes](starting-equipment/lathes.md), and items [Mapped](starting-equipment/mapped.md) by the map creator.

Of these, only the loadout is unavailable for mid-round players receiving a promotion or looking to steal gear. Therefore important items and necessary job equipment should **not** be given in loadouts. This pushes players to visit their department to collect the gear needed to properly do their jobs, connecting them to their department and to their coworkers before they start working in earnest.
