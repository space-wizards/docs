# Department Vending Machines

{{#template ../../../../templates/stub.md}}

## Overview

Department vending machines are access-locked vendors located inside a department. They contain items specific to that department, and players need to share the gear inside. Departments typically have two types of vending machines: equipment and clothing. They can be restocked through a purchase from cargo mid-round.

## Requirements

Equipment vendors contain expendable equipment, spare tools, and optional tools. Gear they provide should be regularly useful to the respective department. They should not have gear that is easily available (such as in an autolathe), even if those items would be useful to the job.

Clothing vendors should spawn with equipable items typical of a department's colors or aesthetic qualities. Items should reflect the standard uniform of a department employee (i.e., Nanotrasen approved).

## Questions for a full doc

```admonish question
Should department vendors contain items for the purpose of distributing them to crew? For example the EngiVend currently has 8 crowbars and 4 welding masks.
```

```admonish question
Should eyewear in general and insuls specifically be moved to the drobe? They're currently found in equipment vendors, but they're clothing and arguably break expectations.
