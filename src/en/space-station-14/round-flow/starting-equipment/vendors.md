# Department Vending Machines

{{#template ../../../../templates/stub.md}}

## Overview

Department vending machines are access-locked vendors located somewhere inside their respective department. They contain items specific to that department, and players need to share the gear inside. Departments typically have two types of vending machines: equipment and clothing. They can be restocked through a purchase from cargo mid-round.

## Requirements

Equipment vendors contain expendable equipment, spare tools, and optional tools. Gear they provide should be regularly useful and sought by players. They should not have gear that is easily available (such as in an autolathe), even if those items would be useful to the job.

Clothing vendors (typically called "Drobes") should spawn with clothing typical of a department's colors or aesthetic qualities. Clothes should reflect the standard uniform of a department employee and include anything available in a loadout (exluding prestige rewards). Every item in a Drobe must be equippable or be considered clothing in an abstract sense (walking cane). Particularly powerful clothing should instead be found in department lockers.
