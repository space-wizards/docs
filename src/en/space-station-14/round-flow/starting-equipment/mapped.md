# Mapped Starting Gear

{{#template ../../../../templates/stub.md}}

## Overview

Maps often contain gear around the department for players. A spawner should exist for these to control and standardize their use through YAML, should a mapper choose to use it.

## Requirements

Mapped items are shared department resources that players divide amongst themselves. They are often consumable materials but can also include spare equipment.
