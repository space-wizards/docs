# Player Loadouts

{{#template ../../../../templates/stub.md}}

## Overview

Loadouts are the items given to a player when they first spawn. Loadouts are different for each role, and loadouts for station jobs give players a small set of options to choose from. These items are generally cosmetic and/or clothing.

## Requirements

Station role loadouts should spawn with department-identifying clothing. At minimum players should spawn with a PDA, a backpack (or variant), a headset with their department's coms channel, and a jumpsuit. Loadouts should **not** contain job-essential equipment that allows a player to do their job without ever visiting their department.
