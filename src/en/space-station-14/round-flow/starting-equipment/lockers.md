# Job Lockers

{{#template ../../../../templates/stub.md}}

## Overview

Many jobs on the station have specific lockers where players can find their equipment for the round. Round-start players spawn near them and spend a few moments sorting through them to prepare for the shift, while mid-round players seek them out for the same reason. Lockers are intended to contain the vital equipment a player needs in order to do their job. Maps are expected to have more lockers than there are job spawns.

## Requirements

Job lockers for a department's standard crew should spawn with all job-essential equipment for that department. A player should want most items found in their locker, or have a clear picture of why they would want them. Lockers should not spawn with cosmetic items, optional/situational tools, or contain expendable equipment that another member of their department might want to raid.

Lockers for specialized jobs in a department (including department heads) should include any equipment present in a "lesser" locker, unless that job has specialized equipment that is equal to or better than the "lesser" equipment. For example, a toolbelt can be replaced by a toolbelt with more space, but an RCD can't be replaced by an RPD. This is another measure meant to prevent players from raiding multiple lockers for gear. A player shouldn't want anything from a locker they have access to that wasn't provided in their own locker.

In addition to their own specialized gear, there are several items present in all command lockers.
 - A personal stamp.
 - A headset with encryption keys for their department and for command.
 - A door remote controlling their department's airlocks.
 - A box containing spare department encryption keys.
 - A box containing spare circuit boards.
