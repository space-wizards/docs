# Job Lockers

{{#template ../../../../templates/stub.md}}

## Overview

Many jobs on the station have specific lockers where players can find their equipment for the round. Round-start players spawn near them and spend a few moments sorting through them to prepare for the shift, while mid-round players seek them out for the same reason. Lockers are intended to contain the vital equipment a player needs in order to do their job. Maps are expected to have more lockers than there are job spawns.

## Requirements

Job lockers for a department's standard crew should spawn with all job-essential equipment for that department. A player should want most items found in their locker, or have a clear picture of why they would want them. Cosmetic items and optional/situational tools should only occasionally appear in lockers, and should be clearly separated from standard items. Expendable equipment and powerful equipment should not found in lockers to discourage raiding the lockers for loot.

Lockers for specialized jobs in a department (including department heads) should include any equipment present in a "lesser" locker, unless that job has specialized equipment that is equal to or better than the "lesser" equipment. For example, a toolbelt can be replaced by a toolbelt with more space, but an RCD can't be replaced by an RPD. This is another measure meant to prevent players from raiding multiple lockers for gear. A player shouldn't want anything from a locker they have access to that wasn't provided in their own locker.

In addition to their own specialized gear, there are several items present in all command lockers.
 - A personal stamp.
 - A headset with encryption keys for their department and for command.
 - A door remote controlling their department's airlocks.
 - A box containing spare department encryption keys.
 - A box containing spare circuit boards for vital machines and computers.
