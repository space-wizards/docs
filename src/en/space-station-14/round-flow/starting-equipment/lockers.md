# Department Lockers

{{#template ../../../../templates/stub.md}}

## Overview

Many jobs on the station have specific lockers where players can find their equipment for the round. Round start players spawn near them and spend a few moments sorting through them to prepare for the shift, while mid-round players seek them out for the same reason. Lockers are intended to contain the vital equipment a player needs in order to do their job. Maps are expected to have more lockers than there are job spawns.

## Requirements

Department lockers should spawn with all job-essential equipment. A player should want most items found in their locker, or have a clear picture of why they would want them. Lockers should not spawn with cosmetic items, optional/situational tools, or contain expendable equipment that another member of their department might want to raid.
