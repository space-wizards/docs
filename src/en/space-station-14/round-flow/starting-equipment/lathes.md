# Lathe Equipment

{{#template ../../../../templates/stub.md}}

## Overview

Most departments can print additional job gear from a machine using shared resources. Some have an autolathe to print spare gear, while others have department-specific lathes for this purpose.

## Requirements

Items available to be printed round start from lathes might be tools or expendables. In both cases the options available should be the basic, minimum gear to do the job. Specialized equipment should be acquired later in-round either through purchases at cargo or as a result of science research.
