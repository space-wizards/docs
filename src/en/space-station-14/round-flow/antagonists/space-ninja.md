# Space Ninja

## Overview

The Space Ninja is a midround antagonist primarily focused on station disruption and sabotage, de-emphasizing lethality for crew in favor of stealth and avoiding direct confrontation. Playing as the Space Ninja should feel "cool"; slipping past crew into restricted areas to complete objectives, doing silent takedowns on unsuspecting targets and escaping danger as bullets fly past. For crew the Space Ninja should be a force that disrupts regular station work, but that one can be safe from by staying together with other crew.

## Background

Space Ninjas are a classic SS13 antagonist, and its inclusion in SS14 fills a niche of being a solo midround antagonist that doesn't directly focus on death and destruction, instead opting to cause issues for the station in other ways. Before this document was written the role has been in the game for a long time and largely seen as an enjoyable antagonist for both the player and crew. It features unique theming in the form of the "Spider Clan", a nefarious shadow cult that aims to... well, do evil ninja stuff. The specifics don't matter: You are a bad-ass sci-fi ninja. Get the job done.

## Features

Some staples of the Ninja kit includes:
- Toggleable invisibility
- Teleportation, with some limitations
- Ability to stun singular targets
- High mobility, low resistances
- Built-in space protection
- No ability to use guns
- Cool sword & ninja aesthetics

Example objectives:
- Reach the R&D server in Science (generally in an off-limits area) and destroy researched Technologies
- EMAG doors around the station, enabling trespass and making spacing worse
- Reach a Communications Console (generally in the Bridge) and call in another, more dangerous antagonist
- Bomb a given location, destroying infrastructure
- Reach a Criminal Records computer (mostly in restricted Security & Sec Outposts areas) and sabotage the records data

## Roundflow & Player Interaction

As a midround antagonist, the Space Ninja is the most effective once the round has progressed a bit. This allows the Ninja to counteract progress that has been made in the round, lets the crew settle in a bit and makes it possible to utilize some pre-existing chaos. 

The Space Ninja should be the apex 1v1 combatant but drop off *heavily* in effectiveness if up against more than one foe. This gives crew a clear way of countering the Ninja by grouping up, which has its own inherent downsides by slowing down crew and making it harder to defend multiple locations. Additionally the Ninja should encourage an ambush-heavy playstyle. To accomplish this, the Ninja should not have high resistances (making advancing on an aware target more punishing) and instead focus should be put on abilities that lets it get the drop on people.

While the Space Ninja should promote ambush tactics which necessitates a stealth element, it's important to make the distinction that the Space Ninja is *not a "stealth antagonist"*. While the station should not be notified the moment a Ninja appears, achieving objectives should still involve overt actions that signal to the crew that a Space Ninja is on the station. This allows the role to make an impact through existence as the crew gets a chance to apply countermeasures (e.g. raising alert levels, arming for weapons, preparing for ambushes). Unlike other stealth antagonists that avoid detection through hiding in plain sight (e.g. Traitors, Revolutionaries, Changelings) the Ninja aims to simply avoid hostile forces altogether. The goal of an ambush should be to gain some equipment and/or disable an opponent to complete an objective or escape danger. 

Once the Ninja has completed its objectives, since it doesn't rely on station destruction (Nukies, Space Dragon, Zombies) or integrating into crew to evacuate to CentComm safely (Traitors, Thieves), the Ninja requires some alternate end condition. While a Ninja is disruptive it should not on its own be enough to cause the station to evacuate and thus end the round (though crew may opt to do so anyways). Therefore the Ninja needs some encouragement to either continuously perform their objectives, or have a way to exit the round once the player is satisfied with their performance.

Since the Space Ninja focuses on ambushes and avoidance, it is important to balance the role such that the tools meant to enable those tactics can't also be used for undesirable gameplay. Often a move that disables an opponent can make it trivially easy to kill them as well, and tools that make it easier to escape dangerous situations can also make it easier to initiate combat scenarios. Crew should also feel that there is sufficient counterplay tacitcs against a Space Ninja that does not just result in a status quo. If a Ninja gets into a disadvantageous position the avoidance mechanics should not be so strong as to prevent any consequence for misplay. The Space Ninja should not encourage lethal gameplay, but some lethality is still desired to some degree make them an imposing antagonist and to let the Ninja deal with opponents that can't be ambushed/stunned or otherwise requires dispatching. Careful attention needs to be paid to how this lethality is implemented as to avoid encouraging Ninjas to use its kit to become a "maints slasher" that murders lone crew indiscriminately.

## Administrative & Server Rule Impact (if applicable)

The main concern with the Space Ninja is the risk of using its abilities to cause more death than is desired for the role. Mechanics should be balanced such that the Ninja is discouraged to use its abilities to directly cause death and round remove other players.
