## Overview
This proposal aims to make the Revenant much more interesting by deviating from SS13 canon.
Revenant should stop having a "*high threshold*" at which the player has nowhere else to grow. 

_This suggestion is inspired by the Revenant from D&D 5th edition._
## Background
Revenant is trivially unable to bring anything interesting to the round at the moment. Compared to a dragon that is on par with him for ninjis he is a pathetic child.
The reasons for that:
1. He's obsolete. His abilites are long outdated, he can't pose any threats to a crew ready for him, and his attempts at conversation are ignored.
2. Revenant gets all of his abilites very quickly in the right situations and he has trivially nowhere to grow

I think my proposed changes would make the revenant much more annoying, interesting, and dangerous

```admonish note "Thoughts"
Revenant is an angry soul. Someone who didn't like his death and decided to start scaring the crew by sucking out their souls and smashing lamps.
Let this soul get his second chance. With the help of skills, it will be able to return to the round for the original character. 
```

### New possibilities
First and foremost, the Revenant should be given the ability to toggle its invulnerability. Why? He is trivially overlooked until he appears in front of people.
This is an introduction ability. It's not really related to the ideas of the proposal. It just makes them easier to execute

| Ability | Activation Price | Purchase Price |
|---|---|---|
| Switching visibility | 0 | Unlocked from the beginning |

Next up.

| Ability | Activation Price | Purchase Price |
|---|---|---|
| Voice Change | 0 | ~30 stolen essences |

Speaking for the dead is fun. It will also make for more interesting situations.

You might want to ask your friends to bring souls?

| Ability | Activation price | Purchase price |
|---|---|---|
| Resurrection | 0 | ~250 stolen essences |

An ultimatum that completely changes the gameplay of Revenant. You come back to life as the character you entered Revenant as(character choice when someone figures out how to code it :trollface:).
### Humanoid?
```admonish abstract "After"
You are completely naked. You are not on the manifest. You are an intruder to those around you. You remember everything. Who killed you, what you became and how you were reborn. What drives you? A desire for revenge? Do you want to kill the one who took your life, or are you beyond that now?
You have all the attributes of a humanoid. Hunger, health, the need for water. But you are still a Revenant, you remember all the abilities you learned in your past form (except for changing your voice, as your vessel is incapable of such acts), you have a stockpile of souls, but you are now confined to human form. 
```
```admonish tip "Base"
**You can no longer see through walls, you can no longer fly through walls, and so on.**
In humanoid form, all of your revenant abilities can only be used in "active" form. Your body will glow purple, your speed will increase slightly, as will your body's water and hunger consumption. 
Bible thumping will make you fall into a stunned stupor
**The game will not burden you with objectives, play as you see fit**
```

| Ability | Activation Price | Purchase Price |
