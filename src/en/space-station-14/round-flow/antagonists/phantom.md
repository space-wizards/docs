## Overview

Phantom is a ghost antagonist like Revenant. However, when Revenant is just a murdering ghost, Phantom has specific goals, and can not commit genocide at the beginning.
Phantom's gameplay revolves around haunting single players to make them do all dirty work. Because of his weakness at the beginning, this is the only way.

## Background

Phantom is another version of Revenant. However, his abilities and gaining them have much difference. Phantom can haunt a crew member, make them a Vessel and turn Vessel into a Cursed. His abilities depends on his Vessels count. He have 5 levels, each one grants 3 new abilities.
Phantom can have maximum 10 Vessels. If he reaches this count, he can select his "ending" to finish the round.

Phantom is a roleplay based antagonist. He has no background, so all Phantom players can play as they wish and create a countless different stories. 

Phantom's worst enemy is a chaplain. He have to stop Phantom from reaching his objectives no matter what.

## Vessels

Vessels are the first stage of Phantom's minions. They can not know they are a Vessel and have their will. They get damage from holy or ectoplasmic weapons.
When Vessel dies, he turns into a poltergeist.

## Cursed

Cursed is the second stage of Phantom's minions. They know who they are and have their will ONLY if it does not contradict Phantom's orders. They get double holy and ectoplasmic damage.
Cursed can create a ghost weapon on their hands and heal.
