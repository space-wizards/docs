## Overview

Traitors is the bread and butter default gamemode of space station 14. Traitors gamemode is characterized by a select number of crewmembers being selected to betray the station, hindering its functionality and pursuing their own goals. 

## Game Design Rationale

Traitors by design should be as loose as possible in terms of restrictions. They are designed to betray the station and hinder it as much as possible, if Traitors can do this too easily the gamemode ceases to be interesting. Traitors should be an expression of creativity with objectives that are direct and simple but have many different ways to be accomplished to facillitate creativity. 

Traitors should also be evasive, their primary strength is that they are normal crewmembers covered by space law, but that doesn't save them if they're easy to catch. Their arsenal should consist of cheap and reliable stealth and deception options which can keep them just out of reach of security as long as possible. 

### Tools

The main hinderance of traitors should be resources. Health, ammo, and materials with much of their time being spent trying to gather resources to do their objectives. They shouldn't feel like their uplink has enough resources to complete all their objectives, but also never feel like it's impossible to get these resources.
Do:
- A traitor needs to prevent a department from functioning, so they scrounge up some materials to create a bomb which will level that department.
- As one of their many objectives a traitor has to kill the captain. They spend time finding a source of armor, ammunition and a disguise so they can ensure they can kill the captain and ensure escape into the shadows before security can catch them. 
Dont: 
- A traitor with one kill objective buys a gun with plenty of magazines and kills their target. They then spend the rest of the round doing nothing.
- A traitor needs to disable a single machine in a department, so they buy a single brick of C4 to level it.

Traitors, being a main round antag, should be driving the round and their objectives and tools should reflect that. Similarly to the ninja, traitors should be an evasive threat that's hard but possible to pin down, who causes lots of disruption when not dealt with. Unlike the ninja, the traitor should have a lot more freedom in their ability to accomplish this. Deception, Stealth, Sabatoge, Murder, and anything else a traitor can think of should be on the menu. 

Stealth and deception tools should be ubiquitous. Traitors gain a lot by blending in with the station, and it makes them interesting. Stealth, however, is very strong in combat as well so all tools need to be balanced carefully. 

#### Tools of Deception: Blending In

Tools that help a traitor blend in. These tools are best suited for a traitor with big plans that rely heavily on deception and subterfuge. An ideal tool of deception concretely support any deception a traitor may try to pull off, with the main pitfalls being the deception itself. A tool of deception doesn't really work if there's a master key that can quickly or easily negate it, rather the station should have to try and actively disprove the deception. The usefulness of these tools, much like tools of violence, comes down entirely to the skill of the traitor using them being compared to the skills of those they are using them against. 

Anything which changes a traitor's identity, or changes concrete station information would be considered a tool of deception. These tools should never directly benefit a traitor in combat, only be used to evade and misdirect which can buy a traitor more time, or more resources. 

#### Tools of Stealth: Evading Detection

Tools that help a traitor forward their objectives stealthily. These are different from tools of deception in that they are intended to help prevent discovery while an agent is being proactive. These would include items which disrupt vision or communication, and tools or weapons which appear to be something completely mundane. 

Unlike tools of deception, these tools are useful for a wide variety of approaches and actively useful in completing objectives. As such they should be designed with much clearer flaws and limitations so that they aren't oppressive, especially in regards to items which could assist with an ambush in combat. Ideally stealth items should be proactively used, not something that you keep on you which provides a passive and permanent beneift. Generally these items should be easier to unmask compared to items of deception, the point of these items are to help you from getting caught after all.

Do:
- A disguise that lets you pull off a one time ambush before it needs to be recharged or discarded.
- An invisible box that lets you sneak into places, but prevents tool usage while active.
- An normal pen which when triggered can hack open doors, but takes a while to do so.
- A gun that looks like a normal briefcase.
- An item which jams communications and cameras delaying the ability for the station to respond to your attack on a department.
Dont:
- A suit with a rechargeable battery that makes you invisible while also providing armor.
- A set of gloves which allows you to strip items quietly and are completely indistuishable from normal gloves. 

#### Tools of Sabatoge: Bending the Station's Assets to Your Will

These tools generally cover items which assist a traitor in hindering the station or collecting resources for their objectives. These would include items which allow a traitor to hack open doors, hack lathes to print ammo, or blow a hole through a wall. 

These items can be used alongside stealth, but shouldn't ever be stealth tools or exclusively useful for stealth. They should be obvious when seen, obviously syndicate contraband, but also quick and easy to use. Speed is often your best friend in both combat and stealth, a single second could mean the difference between getting caught and getting away! Ideally, these tools should have broad usecases so they're rarely a sunk cost purchase, but never to the point where they become an "all-in-one" tool.

Do:
- You buy a station blackout to give you the cover of darkness to sneak into a place you shouldn't be sneaking into.
- You buy an item which draws a lot of power from engineering and if it isn't dealt with quickly, it explodes violently. 
Dont:
- You buy an item which allows you to make a massive portion of the station uninhabitable and leaves behind zero evidence of who did it.
- You buy an item which allows you to hack doors, hack borgs, print ammo, and change your PDA light in one compact package.
- You buy an item which allows you to hack one very specific door on the station and nothing else.

#### Tools of Violence: Making the Station Bleed

Tools which are useful for those with the intent to disable or kill crewmembers. This includes both lethal and nonlethal weapons, since nonlethal weapons typically give lethal opportunities. These tools must be threatening, they are what give the traitor the backbone to make security second guess chasing a traitor into maintenance alone. 

Weapons should be balanced with a "role" in mind, and no two weapons should feel identical in use and playstyle. For example, an smg and a shotgun may both be loud weapons designed to kill, but they play distinctly differently due to different firerates, sizes, and ammunition available. Two guns could use the same ammo type, but one may be silent with a lower firerate, making it a strong assassination weapon. 

What's most key for all weapons should be none should ever be the best for all situations. A powerful gun that can deal a lot of sustained damage should never be stealthy, and always be large. A silenced gun may be great for single target assassinations but doesn't have the DPS or magazine size to sustain itself in a firefight. Melee weapons trade reliability for range. Explosives are loud, obvious, expensive, clunky to use, and limited in their availability. 

Armor is incredibly useful, argubaly more than guns. Guns can be acquired easily without an uplink if you know where to get them, so armor is often the more pressing purchase. Armor should always be visually obvious and distinct, one should be able to immediately tell that you're a traitor if you're wearing traitor armor. It's not a purchase you make if you're trying to do anything subtle. Armor should be bulky, expensive, obvious, and greatly extend your survivability. 

As such these tools should be balanced cost wise where if you want all the tools to commit unspeakable acts of violence and only violence, you will exhaust your TC budget and still be lacking in some areas which will require some planning. Maybe you don't have enough medicine? Maybe you don't have enough ammo? Maybe you're gonna need to find a weapon? Maybe you only have one weapon? Maybe if you get cornered you have no way out? Violence should be a test of game knowledge and skill in and out of combat to acquire the tools to make a strong kit. 

#### Tools of Utility: Keeping Yourself Useful

This covers "everything else" which completes a traitor's kit. Primarily items which extend a traitor's survivability. These would include: medicine, speed enhancers, or teleporters. Anything which keeps a traitor alive and out of cuffs without being necessarily made for violence would fall into this category. These items should be cheap since they extend a traitor's impact on the round, but they shouldn't last forever. 

Do:
- You buy an implant for a negligible amount of TC which gives you the opportunity to evade security in a pinch, but only a limited number of times.
- You buy a one time use healing item which heals a sizable chunk of your damage for a small TC cost allowing you to turn the tables in a skirmish you would've lost otherwise.
- You buy a crate full of materials for a small amount of TC to build a nefarious contraption with.
Dont: 
- You buy an item which lets you inject effectively limitless medicine and drugs into your bloodstream instantly.
- You spend a large chunk of your budget on a kit of stimulants which are only enough to evade security once or twice.

### Objectives

Traitors should have either many objectives which strongly impact the round through small sabatoges that are felt by everyone through quantity, or large objectives which everyone feels if accomplished. No objective should have one clear path to complete it, and no objective should be so unimpactful that the general station reaction is a shrug and moving on to more important things. The consequences objectives should feel so important that completing them creates conflict with other traitors potentially encourging infighting or cooperation.

Do:
- A traitor has to kill multiple people. They get a gun and some utility items to perform a number of hit and run attacks which keep the station on its toes for a while.
- A traitor has to kill the captain, so they disguise as the head of security and assassinate the captain stealthily allowing them to continue acting antagonistically throughout the round.
- A traitor has to sabatoge a piece of key infrastructure so they spend the majority of the round preparing the tools needed to disable it, then break in and kill anyone trying to stop them. This action forces evac to be called.
- A traitor needs to keep science from completing their research so they spend the majority of the round blowing up anomalies and sabatoging the science department.
Dont:
- A traitor has a steal objective, this will put a target on their back the whole round so they stealthly take the item on evac after doing nothing the whole round.
- A traitor needs to steal the cheif engineer's magboots, so they kill the chief engineer then hide in space the whole shift.
- A traitor has to kill one random passenger and survive. The passenger is killed in maintenance and nobody notices or particularly cares.
- One traitor has to steal one item and escape, three traitors need to help them do their objectives. All of them need to not get caught.  

### Solo Antagonists

Traitors are solo antagonists with their own objectives. This should be enforced by not or very rarely encouraging teamwork. Help objectives should be rare, items which require two traitors to collaborate to use shouldn't exist, and objectives should conflict naturally and not directly. Ideally we don't want traitors to be relying on other traitors either through "I need to assassinate this traitor" or "I need this traitor to do one thing so I can help/stop them". 

Traitors works best when you can reliably act on your own with teamwork being a nice optional bonus for those willing to spend the time organizing a coordinated plan. 

## Roundflow & Player interaction

Players should feel the impact of traitors as the round progresses. Ideally the traitors gamemode is a slow burn similar to survival. There's a couple highlights here and there, but things begin to ramp up as the round progresses and traitors with larger and more difficult objectives begin completing or attempting to complete them. Department heads should start going missing and require replacements, machines should start breaking and require workarounds, and the station should struggle to maintain operation. 

Traitors should be felt but often unseen. Part of the traitor experience should be the worry about who is a traitor, as such unmasking and catching all traitors should be a rare but possible outcome. Most rounds should end with all traitors completing some of their objectives with a few completing them all. 

A round where the majority of traitors completely redtext and nothing happens should be completely avoided if possible. On the other hand, a round where all traitors greentext and completely sweep the station and security department should be exceedingly rare.

The game should sit in a sweet spot in the middle where security feels they have to do random searches to catch up to the traitors and keep the peace, while the crew is held back in an upward battle against traitors sabatoging their departments. 

A typical round of traitors should start with each traitor recieving their list of objectives. These objectives should encourage antagonistic activity throughout the round either due to quantity or difficulty. 

Higher quantity objectives should be easy to complete, hard to reverse and have a tangible impact on the round but not be round ending. These could include killing a random crewmember or actively sabatoging some common machine. This allows even new traitors to have some tangible impact on the round even if they get immediately caught and executed. 

A higher difficulty objective would be something which requires active effort to complete. These shouldn't be something you can wait until evac to do, for example you may need to prevent a department from functioning normally lest they complete some objective, or you may need to prepare yourself to do one very difficult job which will draw a lot of attention once you start on it. In both scenarios the Traitor should be encouraged to spend the round causing problems either to complete their objective or gather resources for their objective. 

## Administrative & Server Rule Impact (if applicable)

If we balance traitors properly, we can loosen 2.9 further which is always a good thing. Weakening combat through limiting resources such as ammo, while strengthing stealth and increasing objectives overall should make traitor rounds more interesting and fun.
