## Overview

Traitors is the bread and butter default gamemode of space station 14. Traitors gamemode is characterized by a select number of crewmembers being selected to betray the station, hindering its functionality and pursuing their own goals. 

## Game Design Rationale

Traitors by design should be as loose as possible in terms of restrictions. They are designed to betray the station and hinder it as much as possible, if Traitors can do this too easily the gamemode ceases to be interesting. Traitors should be an expression of creativity with objectives that are direct and simple but have many different ways to be accomplished to facillitate creativity. 

Traitors should also be evasive, their primary strength is that they are normal crewmembers covered by space law, but that doesn't save them if they're easy to catch. Their arsenal should consist of cheap and reliable stealth and deception options which can keep them just out of reach of security as long as possible. 

### Tools

The main hinderance of traitors should be resources. Health, ammo, and materials with much of their time being spent trying to gather resources to do their objectives. They shouldn't feel like their uplink will enough resources to complete all their objectives, but also never feel like it's impossible to get these resources.
Do:
- A traitor needs to kill prevent a department from functioning, so they start scrounging materials to create a bomb which will disable the department
- As one of their many objectives, a traitor has to kill the captain, so they spend time finding a source of armor, ammunition and a disguise so they can ensure they can kill the captain and escape into the shadows before security can catch them. 
Dont: 
- A traitor with one kill objective buys a gun with plenty of magazines and kills their target. They then spend the rest of the round doing nothing.
- A traitor needs to disable a single machine in a department, so they buy a single brick of C4 to level it.

Traitors, being a main round antag, should be driving the round and their objectives and tools should reflect that. Similarly to the ninja, traitors should be an evasive threat that's hard but possible to pin down, who causes lots of disruption when not dealt with. Unlike the ninja, the traitor should have a lot more freedom in their ability to accomplish this. Deception, Stealth, Sabatoge, Murder, and anything else a traitor can think of should be on the menu. 

Stealth and deception tools should be ubiquitous. Traitors gain a lot by blending in with the station, and it makes them interesting. Stealth, however, is very strong in combat as well so all tools need to be balanced carefully. 

#### Tools of Deception

Tools of deception are to be used by a traitor to blend in. They should support a traitor who is trying to play it smart with big plans, and as such they should be hard to discredit. An ideal tool of deception concretely support any deception a traitor may try to pull off, with the main pitfalls being the deception itself. A tool of deception doesn't really work if there's a master key that can quickly or easily negate it, rather the station should have to try and actively disprove the deception. 

Anything which changes a traitor's identity, or changes concrete station information would be considered a tool of deception. These tools should never directly benefit a traitor in combat, only be used to evade and misdirect which can buy a traitor more time, or more resources. 

#### Tools of Stealth

Tools of stealth are to be used by a traitor to evade detection. They are distinct from deception tools in that they are intended to be tools which directly forward an agent's objectives while also preventing discovery. This would include items with jam communications, obscure or occlude a traitors physical appearance, or tools which cannot be detected through observation. Unlikes tools of deception, these tools are often used to complete objectives while also doubling as ways to evade detection. As such they need to be balanced differently compared to tools of deception. These items can directly aid in combat but should be designed with limitations such that they are not unfair in combat.

Do:
- A disguise that lets you pull off a one time ambush before it needs to be recharged or discarded
- An invisible box that lets you sneak into places, but prevents tool usage while active
- An normal pen which can hack open doors, but takes a while to do so.
- A gun that looks like a normal briefcase.
- An item which jams communications and cameras delaying the ability for the station to respond to your attack on a department
Dont:
- A suit with a rechargable battery that makes you invisible while also providing armor.

#### Tools of Sabatoge

These tools generally cover items which assist a traitor in hindering the station or collecting resources for their objectives. These would include items which allow a traitor to hack open doors, hack lathes to print ammo, or blow a hole through a wall. These items can be stealthy but shouldn't ever be stealth tools. They should be obvious when seen, clearly labeled as syndicate contraband, and trade their obviousness for ease of use and hasteness. Sometimes your best friend in stealth is being able to get that door open in under one second, and in combat or when evading arrest getting a door open quickly can mean the difference between life and death. 

Do:
- You buy a station blackout to give you the cover of darkness to sneak into a place you shouldn't be sneaking into.
Dont:
- You buy an item 

#### Tools of Violence

These cover the tools which a traitor uses to kill or disable others. This category includes both lethal and nonlethal weapons, since nonlethal weapons don't truly exist. A stunned or asleep target is a dead target if you know what you're doing. These tools should be threatening and very powerful, if a traitor's weapons are weak, they're not much of a threat. The limitations should be primarily resource based. A melee weapon is strong, but it doesn't afford you the ability to hurt anyone not in your immediate vicinity. A gun is powerful, but you may not have the ammo to kill everyone you meet. Armor is useful, but it's obvious, expensive, and bulky. A traitor who goes all in on violence should be sacrificing safety options for evading capture or detection. It should be an incredibly risky and unreliable strategy rewarded by being a true test of skill. As such these tools should be balanced cost wise where if you want all the tools to commit unspeakable acts of violence and only violence, you will exhaust your TC budget completely, and still be lacking in some areas which will require some planning. Maybe you don't have enough medicine? Maybe you don't have enough ammo? Maybe you're gonna need to find a weapon? Violence should be a test of game knowledge and skill in and out of combat to acquire the tools to make a strong kit. 

#### Tools of Utility

This covers "everything else" which completes a traitor's kit. Primarily items which extend a traitor's survivability. These would include: medicine, speed enhancers, or teleporters. Anything which keeps a traitor alive and out of cuffs without being necessarily made for violence would fall into this category. These items should be cheap since they extend a traitor's impact on the round, but they shouldn't last forever. 

Do:
- You buy an implant for a negligible amount of TC which gives you the opportunity to evade security in a pinch, but only a limited number of times.
- You buy a one time use healing item which heals a sizable chunk of your damage for a small TC cost allowing you to turn the tables in a skirmish you would've lost otherwise.
- You buy a crate full of materials for a small amount of TC to build a nefarious contraption with.
Dont: 
- You buy an item which lets you inject effectively limitless medicine and drugs into your bloodstream instantly .
- You spend a large chunk of your budget on a kit of stimulants which are only enough to evade security once or twice.

### Objectives

Traitors should have either many objectives which strongly impact the round through small sabatoges that are felt by everyone through quantity, or large objectives which everyone feels if accomplished. No objective should have one clear path to complete it, and no objective should be so unimpactful that the general station reaction is a shrug and moving on to more important things. Their objectives should feel important so much so that it may bring them into conflict with other traitors.

Do:
- A traitor has to kill multiple people, so they get a gun and some utility items to perform a number of hit and run attacks which keep the station on its toes for a while.
- A traitor has to kill the captain, so they disguise as the head of security and assassinate the captain stealthily allowing them to continue acting antagonistically throughout the round
- A traitor has to sabatoge a piece of key infrastructure so they spend the majority of the round preparing the tools needed to disable it, then break in and kill anyone trying to stop them. This action forces evac to be called.
- A traitor needs to keep science from completing their research so they spend the majority of the round blowing up anomalies and sabatoging the science department.
Dont:
- A traitor needs to steal the nuclear authentication disk, this will put a target on their back the whole round so they stealthly take the disk from the captain on evac.
- A traitor needs to steal the cheif engineer's magboots, so they kill the chief engineer then hide in space the whole shift.
- A traitor has to kill one random passenger and survive. The passenger is killed in maintenance and nobody notices or particularly cares.
- One traitor has to steal one item, three traitors need to help them steal one item. None of them can get caught. 

### Solo Antagonists

Traitors are solo antagonists with their own objectives. This should be enforced by not or very rarely encouraging teamwork. Help objectives should be rare, items which require two traitors to collaborate to use shouldn't exist, and objectives should conflict naturally and not directly. Ideally we don't want traitors to be relying on other traitors either through "I need to assassinate this traitor" or "I need this traitor to do one thing so I can help/stop them". 

Traitors works best when you can reliably act on your own with teamwork being a nice optional bonus for those willing to spend the time organizing a coordinated plan. 

## Roundflow & Player interaction

Players should feel the impact of traitors as the round progresses. Ideally the traitors gamemode is a slow burn similar to survival, there's a couple highlights here and there but things begin to ramp up as the round progresses and traitors with larger more difficult objectives begin completing or attempting to complete them. Department heads should start going missing requiring replacements, machines should start breaking requiring workarounds as the station struggles to replace them. 

Traitors should be felt but often unseen. Part of the traitor experience should be the worry about who is a traitor, as such unmasking and catching all traitors should be a rare but possible outcome. Most rounds should end with all traitors completing some of their objectives with a few completing them all. 

A round where the majority of traitors completely redtext and nothing happens should be completely avoided if possible. 

On the other hand, a round where all traitors greentext and completely sweep the station and security department should be exceedingly rare.

The game should sit in a sweet spot in the middle where security feels they have to do random searches to catch up to the traitors and keep the peace, while the crew is held back in an upward battle against traitors sabatoging their departments. 

## Administrative & Server Rule Impact (if applicable)

If we balance traitors properly, we can loosen 2.9 further which is always a good thing. Weakening combat through limiting resources such as ammo, while strengthing stealth and increasing objectives overall should make traitor rounds more interesting and fun.
