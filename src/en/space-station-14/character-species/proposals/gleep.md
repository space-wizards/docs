## Overview 

This proposal is about the Gleep species as a playable roundstart species. Gleep's are a fish-snail like alien species, easily identified by their shells, which is
also their center gimmick

(Writing docs is hard so sorry if its a tad messy u.u)

## Background 

Gleeps are an original species, the name is just cute and silly wihout any special meaning

## Why!!

Oki so im giving myself this spot to yap in a very non professional way.
None of the current species feel the sort of creature vibes i would likey, sure theres dionas which are very inhuman and cool but the vibes they have are very limited and they dont seem very comfy huggable imo.
So having a squishy soft species with bright colorful eyes making silly alien sounds that can hide in their shell when scared seems very gender comfy so yeah thats why i likey them conceptually. Also why they are
not a super accurate representation of a snail or fish. I wanna them to feel alien out there weird wacky, monster vibes even, not just a humanoid already known animal

## Design

Going for an inhuman alien vibe, wanting them to feel visually distinct from just a snail or a fish. None of the current species have the sort of smooth soft huggable vibes i would likey (slimes are the closest,
but are kinda humans 2.0 too human icki), so it would be a different aesthetic to what we have while fitting the vibes of wacky space

Im specially avoiding making them legless, which while it would fit a snail, its something dionas already do and its really visually limiting to remove that clothing slot from the player. Ideally gleeps would be 
very expressive, rather than being forced into a couple of certain vibes.

## Core Visual Elements

Sticky boneless smooth soft bodies, sorta fishy vibes while still maintaining a snail-like skin. They may possess gills, bioluminescent spots or different sort of antenna/eyes as markings
The sounds they make would be generally spacey stereotypical alien sounds (i am having a hard time describing it)

## Species Features

### Shell 

Gleeps have a big shell in their backs, gameplay wise it operates like an unremovable backpack with a spiral shaped storage. 
In return, trough an action they are able to quickly hide inside their shell, losing the ability to move and use items, and gaining spacing immunity, they can be picked up while in this state.

Exiting their shell would require a lenghtly do after,  during combat it would be a big commitment to enter your shell, as it would be easy for a syndie to keep hitting you, or a secoff to just pick you up and 
carry you to sec. 
(It's meant to be mostly a silly rp purpose ability, carrying the scared hop hiding inside their shell in your hands would be fun)

### Sticky 

When picking an item without gloves on, it will be covered in a thin weak layer of slime-like glue, which Gleep themselves are immune to. (doesnt affect them at all, they will drop items like normal)

### Bioluminescence 

When splashed by a chemical, Gleeps will glow according to its color.

### Salt 

Being a snail-like species, salt is highly toxic to them.
