## Overview
This proposal is for the Integrated Photonic Chassis Species. IPCs are an alien robotic race not bound to silicon laws. Where there would be skin and bone there is steel; where there would be muscles and joints there is myomer and linkages.

Though bound to a humanoid shape, appearances may still vary widely thanks to their robotic origins. IPCs fill the robotic niche, without being a narrowly focused silicon bound to laws.

## Background
The Integrated **Photonic** Chassis is inspired by SS13's and SS14's Integrated **Positronic** Chassis, though distancing itself for gameplay balance purposes.
There have been no tests for IPCs on Wizard's Den, though downstream servers do use IPCs. There is an interest to bringing IPCs upstream.

## Design
IPCs are meant to cover a player's desired niche of a robotic character, without being a law bound silicon. IPCs use different core mechanics than other organic species, though similar enough that it shouldn't be too jarring to play.

The largest difference from the standard IPCs is the Photonic; IPCs as per this doc do not use a positronic brain, they use a photonic brain that is mechanically identical to standard brains. The reason for this is to prevent edge cases where an IPC is gibbed and instantly rats out their murderer over binary comms.

## Core Visual Elements
IPCs are bipedal humanoids. While their silhouette is similar to a human or slimeperson, their bodies and limbs are visually distinct in that they are mechanical, and the iconic TV head. The sounds they make are robotic and mechanical in nature, similar if not identical to the sounds cyborgs make.

## Mechanics
### Overheat
IPCs, like many other computers and machines, operate best within a narrow temperature range. Too hot, and the IPC shuts down to avoid critical damage; too cold, and the myomers struggle to expand or contract.

### Coolant
IPCs use a hydrocarbon based dielectric coolant with self sealing properties in place of blood.

The coolant does not carry any gas for respiration, instead it regulates the IPC's temperature. Low coolant levels can lead to overheating. Coolant can be made by chemists, or processed by the IPC by drinking ethanol.

Being exposed to low pressure environments can cause the coolant to boil off, eventually resulting in the IPC overheating.

### Powered
IPCs utilize an internal fuel cell to generate power in conjunction with a supercapacitor to handle load spikes or loss of main power.

The fuel cell uses oxygen and any flammable liquid at varying efficiencies such as welding fuel, vodka, liquid tritium, or even its own coolant in an emergency.

IPCs are resistant to EMPs, but are still stunned by them. Complete loss of power will result in the IPC shutting down.

### Repairs
IPCs do not heal naturally and cannot use most medical chemicals or topicals.

IPCs can jury rig repairs using common tools and materials found on the station, though the process is very inefficient and time consuming.

Other people can repair the IPC more efficiently and rapidly.

The tools and materials needed for repair depend on the damage taken.

Science's exosuit fabricator and the medical techfab can produce repair kits that act similar to the standard topicals.
