## Overview


This proposal seeks to cover a potential rework of SS14’s Dwarves as they currently are, into a Crustacean/Isopod 
inspired species known as Twerg, based upon the old High German name for Dwarves, This name is notably subject to change if desired though.
This change will primarily concern the cosmetic aspects of Dwarves as a species, including
but not limited to custom sounds, new base sprites, and new additional sprites Ie. Speech boxes. 
Beyond cosmetic changes mechanically Dwarves will be expanded upon, but not completely overhauled.

The Scottish accent dwarves currently have will be moved into the base accent pool (or removed depending on current discussion), 
replaced with a Norse one to reflect the inspirations I am taking from for this rework.

Twerg will retain the dwarf’s ability to heal via metabolizing ethanol, however in exchange for buffing this healing,
Twerg will be more resistant to all other chems, this includes poison, but also medication. 
The hope is that this could provide an interesting medical experience when treating Twerg, and to overall flesh out their pre-existing mechanic. 
Once again, I am open to suggestions here in regards to balance and medical’s overall gameplay experience In addition to the pre-existing mechanic.
Twerg as a species will also be able to eat rotten food and trash to be in line with Isopods being detritivores.

And lastly in addition to these changes, because of the removal of dwarves as they currently stand. 
I seek to port over Trieste Port’s Dwarfism trait, along with its pixel consistent dwarf sprite found in
this PR (https://github.com/Pixeltheaertist/Trieste-Port-14/pull/262) to ensure that those who still wish to play as a dwarf-like character can still do so.


## Background


Dwarves have been very in need of a rework, essentially since they were first added into the game from my understanding, 
and as they currently stand, they do not fit with Space Station 14’s current species standards. 
Many people have expressed the desire for them to be something more than just humans but scaled down 20%.
Based upon original Norse folklore, which mentions dwarves as maggotlike, or to literally be maggots given human form,
I felt that bug-like dwarves would be an interesting way to go. Admittedly Isopods, are not really related to maggots or beetles, 
but I felt they would be one of the more interesting ways to go, with crustaceans not really having a pre-existing niche within Space Station 14’s species.


## Design


### Core Visual Elements

Twerg are an isopod inspired bipedal species which stand at the same height as current SS14 dwarves,
their main form of customization will come from a set of shell markings ranging from the base Isopod one, 
to various other crustacean shells such as horseshoe crab shells or Puget Sound king crab shells. 
Twerg are short, wide, hunched and digitigrade. Much like Vox, they have a very unique shape and silloquette.

Aside from their shells, Twerg will be allowed limited custom facial hair, justified as antennae to retain part of the dwarf aesthetic,
and will be allowed a variety of colors inspired by real life crustaceans and Isopods, 
which can range from vibrant pinks and yellows, to deep dark blacks and browns.

Their noises will likely be bug-like clicking or other sounds derived from various stock bug noises, 
though I am open to considerations regarding potential phobias related to these sounds.

### Species Features


#### Alcoholic Healing

Following current dwarf mechanics, Twerg are still healed by ethanol, with this healing even
increased from the base dwarf healing. This keeps the Dwarf’s tendency for alcoholism, while also making it more ingrained into the species, 
and potentially part of medical’s strategy for treating Twerg

#### Numbness to chemicals

Twerg are a species who have evolved to be hardy, resistant to extreme conditions and substances.
Because of this they are numb to all chemicals aside from Ethanol which acts as mentioned above. 
This could potentially provide an interesting flavor when it comes to medicine, and if people intend to poison dwarves. 
Flavorwise this should coincide with Twerg finding human food, drinks, and chemicals weak and or bland, preferring strongly flavored consumables 

####Detritovore

Twerg are able to eat things such as rotten meat and other various pieces of trash and ingest reagents 
like mold, vomit and vent crud with no issue because of being detritivores, while in real life this is limited 
to organic waste like dead leaves and carcasses, it would be interesting roleplaywise to see Twerg play the role of a small clean-up crew aboard the station.
