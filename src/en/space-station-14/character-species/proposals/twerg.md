## Overview


This proposal seeks to introduce a new species, the Crustacean/Isopod inspired species known as Twerg, 
based upon the old High German name for Dwarves, This name is notably subject to change if desired though.

This species will have custom sounds, brand new sprites, and new additional sprites Ie. Speech boxes. 
Beyond cosmetic changes Twerg mechanics will be based on an expanded version of the abilities previously granted to Dwarves. 

Twerg will have a norse-like accent, focused less on word replacements and more on speech pattern.

Twerg will have the ability to heal by metabolizing ethanol, however in exchange for buffing this healing,
Twerg will be more resistant to all other chems, this includes poison, but also medication. The hope is that this could provide an interesting
medical experience when treating Twerg, and to overall flesh out their pre-existing mechanic. 
Once again, I am open to suggestions here in regards to balance and medical’s overall gameplay experience.
In addition to the pre-existing mechanic, Twerg as a species will also be able to eat rotten food and trash to be in line with Isopods being detritivores.


## Background


Twerg were originally my stand-in for a dwarf replacement, but as of now dwarves no longer exist in Wizden servers. 
I still believe this species is unique enough to stand on its own, and fill a niche that does not currently exist in SS14. 
They are based upon Norse folklore for dwarves, which sometimes describes them as maggotlike, or to literally be maggots given human form. 
So from there I decided on Isopods, which while aren’t related to maggots or beetles, are an interesting species,
and could be further expanded into representing more types of crustaceans like crabs or lobsters.



## Design


### Core Visual Elements

Twerg are a short isopod inspired bipedal species, their main form of customization will come from a 
set of shell markings ranging from the base Isopod one, to various other crustacean shells such as
horseshoe crab shells or Puget Sound king crab shells. Twerg are short, wide, hunched and digitigrade. Much like Vox, they have a very unique shape and silloquette.

Aside from their shells, Twerg will be allowed limited custom facial hair, justified as antennae to lean into a more norse classically dwarfic aesthetic,
and will be allowed a variety of colors inspired by real life crustaceans and Isopods, which can range from vibrant pinks and yellows, to deep dark blacks and browns

Their noises will likely be bug-like clicking or other sounds derived from various stock bug noises,
though I am open to considerations regarding potential phobias related to these sounds.

#### Naming Scheme
The Twerg naming scheme is inspired by the naming conventions of old norse cultures, with their given name,
or first name consisting of either one or two components derived from common words or phrases, 
for example a name with just one component could be “Baggi,” meaning bag, or pack.
A name with two components could be “Bergljót” which comes from the roots “bjǫrg” and “ljótr”, meaning help/salvation and light respectively.
These names are not tied to the character of a Twerg, but rather to their family, as Twerg are often named after their ancestors. 
Along with that, related siblings will often share similar given names, usually keeping the first couple of letters similar or the same.

Twerg Surnames are based on Patronymics and Matronymics, a name that simply means “Son of [Blank]” or “Daughter of [Blank]”. 
So for example, the son of a Twerg named Hallbjǫrg’s Surname would be “Hallbjǫrgsson, or the daughter of a Twerg named “Sveinn” would be “Sveinsdóttir.”

This is somewhat of a simplification of what I could find regarding old Norse naming schemes,
and it does omit certain aspects such as the importance of word order and certain grammatical rules when it comes to Patronymics or Matronymics,
but for simplicity's sake this is what I’m going with.



### Species Features


#### Alcoholic Healing

Twerg are able to uniquely metabolize ethanol, healing basic damage types like brute and heat,
This gives them a tendency toward alcoholism and may potentially add flavor to their roleplay or backgrounds, 
and potentially part of medical’s strategy for treating Twerg.


#### Numbness to chemicals

Twerg are a species who have evolved to be hardy, resistant to extreme conditions and substances. 
Because of this they are resistant to all chemicals aside from Ethanol which acts as mentioned above. 
This could potentially provide an interesting flavor when it comes to medicine, or antag play related to poison. 
Flavorwise this should coincide with Twerg finding human food, drinks, and chemicals weak and or bland,
preferring strongly flavored consumables, this resistance can also come from their naturally sensitive immune system,
similar to that of Horseshoe crabs.


#### Detritovore

Twerg are able to eat things such as rotten meat and other various pieces of trash and ingest reagents like mold,
vomit and vent crud with no issue because of being detritivores, while in real life this is limited to organic waste like dead leaves and carcasses, 
it would be interesting roleplaywise to see Twerg play the role of a small clean-up crew aboard the station.



#### Heat Resilience and damage resistances

inspired by Isopods and certain, air breathing, tropical crabs Twerg take about 30% less heat damage, 
however they are 20% weaker to cold damage


#### Claws

Similarly to vox and Lizard, Twerg have claws which do slash damage instead of blunt.


#### Theobromine and Allicin Toxicity

Theobromine is toxic to crabs, and allicin is toxic to Isopods, so both of these chemicals will poison Twerg,
though not nearly as much as it would poison Lizards or Vox.


#### Metabolism

Twerg, much like Arachnids, have blue copper based blood due to both crabs and Isopods also having copper based blood.

Twerg breath Oxygen like most other species, though they are able to extract oxygen from water vapor as well.
