## Overview

This proposal plans to add a new "Vulpkanin" species as a playable roundstart species.
They are meant to be a species of humanoid canine-like beings, mainly oriented around their customizability and unique abilities or traits.

## Background

Vulpkanin (from now referred to as "Vulps") are one of the fan favourites on many downstream projects, as well as plenty popular in Space Station 13.
Their addition to the upstream was brought up many times, which was always happily welcomed as long as there is a valid design document.
Additionally, vulpkanin were rated very positively by players during their [temporary release during the 2025 April Fools event.](https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14/pull/35395) Meaning this species was tested and was already shown to be very enjoyable to play as.

## Design

Vulps aren't meant to be a very different species with many defining traits. They are meant to an interesting option for someone to pick instead of another species, based on how someone prefers to play the game.
The main things that need to be brought up here are their customizability and defining features.

### Customizability

Vulps, by design, aren't meant to only represent a single canid. Rather instead focusing on being able to fit into several canine-like races by selecting from many diffrent markings. This includes things like ear shapes, tails and fur patterns.
The idea is that the player is able to mix and match those options to create many unique looking canine characters, which could include foxes, jackals, wolves and so on.

### Defining Features

#### Cold Resistance

Due to their fur, vulps are able to resist colder climates. This natively grants them resistance to cold damage, as well as some heat insulation, similiar to winter clothing (but way weaker!). This might also mean increased heat damage, but does not neccessarily have to be the case.

#### Sniffing

With their sensitive noses, vulps are able to sniff reagents to identify what they are. The effect is meant to similiar to how Chemical Analysis Goggles do it, perhaps tweaked to set them apart if that is neccessary.

#### Claws

Naturally, canines have sharp claws and teeth. Vulps will deal a mix of slash and pierce with their melee attacks. The damage is supposed to be slightly higher than default punch damage, maybe around that of a regular shiv.

#### Carnivorous

Vulps are able to eat raw meat and blood without getting sick, as well as regular fruit and plants. They are however poisoned by things such as coffee, chocolate, onions and garlic.

#### Colorblindness

While not a trait directly tied to vulps, they could make for a nice way to add traits for colorblindness, such as Deutranopia. **This is not meant to be permanently tied to the species, instead a selectable trait in the menu.**

#### Unique Sounds

Many species currently have unique sounds and emotes. Most notably reptilians with their tail thumps and moths with their chitters. Vulps would get canine-like sounds, such as barks, howls and whines. These, of course, would be also tied to their unique emotes in the emote wheel.

## Why Vulpkanin?

Currently the game lacks diversity in species, which has been brought up by players many times.
Introduction of Vulps is not meant to be a game-changing additon, instead focusing on simple differances that allow them to stand out in their own way, giving players an additional choice they are able to pick for a little variety in gameplay or simply because of their unique appearance.
A very good reason is the fact Vulps have been tested both on Wizden servers as well as in downstream projects. Their positive reception shows that they would make a good fit for upstream, with a few tweaks.
