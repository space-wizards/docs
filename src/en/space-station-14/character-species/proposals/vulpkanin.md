## Overview

This proposal covers the Vulpkanin species as a playable roundstart species. Vulpkanin are a type of of humanoid canine-like alien species. These species are very diverse, but have a common set of unique abilities that are themed to their canine ancestry.

With their pointed ears and big tails, Vulpkanin are visually distinct from every other species and fill a common niche of type of species a player would want to play as. Their design focuses on simple differances that allow them to stand out without being drastically different to other common species.

## Background

Vulpkanin are one of the fan-favourite species on many Space Station 13 and 14 servers. Their addition to upstream has been brought up many times.

Playing as Vulpkanin was popular during their [temporary release during the 2025 April Fools event.](https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14/pull/35395) During the event, players could play as an early draft of Vulpkanin, and the species received a lot of positive feedback.

This document is meant to expand on the initial implementation to make them stand out in their own way from other species available, ready for a full introduction into the universe.

## Design

Vulpkanin, by design, are similar to lizardpeople, because they cover a wide variety of possible canine-like species a player might want to play as. This means they are distinct from roundstart species that are more specific to a particular species, like Diona or Vox. They don't focus on having major defining traits of their own, and don't drastically alter the experience of playing Space Station 14 compared to other common species.

### Core Visual Elements

Vulpkanin are furred, upright beings. Their universal distinctive features are their noticable canine-like ears, wide shoulders, digitigrade legs and tails, which are commonly visible poking out of their outfits as they go about their business. They make canine noises, such as barks and whines, when speaking, generally sounding more dog or wolf-like than fox-like.

### Species Features

#### Leaping

Vulpkanin are exciteable and agile, and can leap forward short distances. This ability is risky, because it will cause them to be knocked prone if they collide with another mob or a wall. This ability can be situationally useful, acting as a way of being able to cross short gaps or move a little faster in a tense situation. Vulpkanin players can also use this to create funny situations during roleplaying; for example, jumping into a wall when scared, or crashing into a friend they see at the bar.

#### High Level Of Customization

Vulpkanin aren't meant to only represent a single canid species (such as how Vox represent only one avian species). They instead cover a variety of possible canine-like species, accomplished by selecting from many diffrent markings. This includes things like ear shapes, tails and fur patterns. Players can mix and match these options to create many unique looking canine characters, which could include foxes, jackals, wolves and so on, without the need create any additional sub-species with similiar traits.

#### Cold Adaption

Due to their thick fur, Vulpkanin are naturally more resistant to colder climates. This gives them more ability to endure cold damage, and grants them innate heat insulation (which works in a similiar way to winter clothing). Due to heating up faster, they are also weaker to heat, making overheated rooms, fire, and weapons like lasers deadlier to them, as well as making it more difficult to use things such as cryo-medicine to heal them.

#### Carnivore Diet

Much like lizardpeople, Vulpkanin primarliy eat meat. They also suffer from being poisoned by chocolate, and other similar dietary restrictions appropriate to a canine-like species.

#### Messy Drinkers

Vulpkanin tend to spill their drinks everywhere whilst they drink. It doesn't cause them active difficulties drinking, but tends to leave a small mess to clean up.
