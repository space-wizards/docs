## Overview
Proposal for Shrubs as a playable roundstart species, being a humanoid creature/monster vibed species, with their unique traits showcasing this vibe while keeping them
socially functional.

They are eyeless and possess a spooky and powerful mouth that allows them to consume a large amount of things, naturally causing a small mess as they eat. 

## Background 
They are an original species, driven by satisfying my (and hopefully more people) specific creature/alien self expression desires. Inspired by xenos and general 
bioluminescent creatures.

## Design

### Core Visual Elements
They do not have regular eyes and their hair is tentacle-like.
Smooth soft fungal-like in texture bodies with shiny spots, eyeless heads and tentacle-like hair.

While humanoid, they are meant to feel alien and a tad spooky. 

### Species Features

#### Versatile Consumption

Shrubs are capable of safely eating raw materials (steel, glass, plastic, plasma, uranium) and other small objects like wrappers and glasses.

In turn, they go hungry slightly faster.

#### Messy 

Whenever they ingest something they spill a small amount of toxic acidic chemicals.

#### Eyeless Perception

Given their lack of standard eyes, they posses a slightly shorter sight (1-2 tiles)

#### Boneless

Their bodies adapted to survive toxic enviorenments with little food sources, not predators, making their bodies boneless, soft and squishy.
Giving them a Slash and Pierce vulnerability and a Poison and Radiation resistance.

#### Biomass Recyling

Shrops are capable of consuming hunger to create a small amount of biomass flora, mostly creating bioluminescent pulsating spooky plants such as trees, grass and bushes. Rarely producing little fruits or critters
