## Overview
This proposal is for a new roundstart species known as Cyprin. Cyprints are an alien piscine race descended from space carp and dragons, bound by their unique neurobiology. Where a human has a stable mind, a Cyprin have Resonance influenced by electromagnetic waves, where a human has fists, a Cyprin has precise stun strikes.

Though humanoid in shape, their appearance is distinctly piscine with rarely some space dragon features. Cyprints fill a niche for a species with a deep, roleplay-heavy mechanic that significantly alters how they interact with the station.

## Background
The Cyprin are inspired by the original "Thaven" concept, reworked to have a more cohesive identity rooted in space carp/dragon ancestry. The name is derived from *Cyprinidae*, the biological family of carp to focus on this biological origin.

### Lore
The Cyprin did not evolve naturally. They were an unintended consequence of a long forgotten bio-engineering project of a precursor civilization, seeking to create the perfect deep-space explorers.
This ancient civilization observed the hardiness of Space Carp and the formidable intelligence of Cosmic Drakes (Space Dragons), and attempted to merge their traits with a humanoid base. Their goal was to create a species that could:
1. Navigate the Void: Inheriting the Space Carp ability to thrive in the radioactive vacuum of space and handle exotic gases.
2. Build and Operate: Utilize a humanoid form capable of fine manipulation and operate in unison using the Resonance engine.

#### The Great Scattering
The precursor civilization that created the Cyprin was destroyed in what's known as the "Great Scattering," causing their creations, including the proto-Cyprin to be scattered across the galaxy, leading the Cyprin to create their own pockets of civilization cultivated by their Resonances, eventually forgetting about the ancient civilization that created them.

The Resonance engine however kept beating, eventually out of tune. The engine wasn't a physical machine, but a galaxy-wide psionic magnetic field broadcast from a hidden, dying star. This field was meant to allow the ancient civilization to provide Cyrin with operational directives. However, untuned and decaying over millennia, the field has since degraded into the Resonances that define Cyprin society today.

Their brains are biological receivers, perpetually tuned to this field. The Resonance is a fragment of the dead civilization's programming, a piece of cultural data that lodges in the Cyprin's psyche and becomes a part of their identity. This explains odd Resonances such as "Keep Your Resonances Secret" which could have been some sort of security protocol, "The Station is A Living Being" could have been a corrupted philosophical tenet of their creators. "X Is A Holy Place" might be a distorted memory of an important place to the ancient civilization.

#### The Modern Times
The Cyprin are a people with a past they don't understand. Much of them are scattered across the galaxy and have cultivated their own various societies based on the distorted Resonances they feel. They are drawn to the stars not by curiosity, but by the deep resonant call they cannot ignore. They are not monsters, but refugees from a lost world, attempting to build a culture from the broken pieces of one they forgotten.

## Design
Cyprints offer an interesting roleplay opportunity for the players who play them and those around them. Their Resonances encourage them to act in specific and outwards ways that inherently help to craft a narrative for themselves and those around them.

### Core Tenent: Roleplay, Not Enforcement
It is *extremely* vital to understand that Resonances are a **roleplay guide,** not a mechanical enforcement. Players are **never** forced to follow their Resonance to the letter, especially if it would conflict with their survival, other's safety, or their job's duties. The core of the Cyprin experience is internal conflict and roleplayed distress that may inevitably arise from having to compromise over their resonances.

* **Priority of Survival and Duty**: A Cyprin's conflict is often internalized, a struggle between their Resonance and the practical demands of their job or even station safety. For example, a Secoff's Resonance may be "Violence Is Distasteful," but when a nuclear operative is gunning down crew, their duty to protect lives must come first. The compelling story is NOT them refusing to fight, but in the personal turmoil they experience *after* being forced to use lethal force. They may become withdrawn, seek solace in places of comfort, or lament in fury at the situation that forced their hand.
* **Distress Over Punishment**: Violating a Resonance should not have any enforcement mechanic behind it, it should trigger a roleplay response. The "distress" is the character's state. A Cyprin who must go against their Resonance for any reason might roleplay a moment of hesitation, discomfort, and complain regarding it. 
* **Player Agency**: This system grants players agency. They can choose *how* their character responds to violating a Resonance: quiet guilt, loud anguish, anger at those who forced the situation, or becoming withdrawn as their values are eroded by necessity. This allows for one to develop a deep story over the course of a shift.

The Resonance system is built to foster roleplay engagement in many ways:
* **Character-Driven Conflict:** A Cyprin's conflict is the struggle between their Resonance needs and the practical demands of their job or of the station. This creates immediate and interesting character development.
* **Crew-Wide Interaction:** Resonances proactively encourage Cyprints to seek out others, making them roleplay catalysts. Their needs have the potential to become a station subplot that others can choose to engage with or navigate around.
* **Shared Resonance Cultivating Shared Purpose:** Shared Resonances are made to encourage other Cyprins to interact and achieve a shared goal. Interacting with one another and various departments to achieve it. Such as "A Holy Place" where Cyprint must congregate three times per day in a specific area of the station, (or as close as they can legally get to it) and go as far as to attempt to create a suitable place for it. Something that would encourage the interaction with related departments to create such a thing.

### Core Visual Elements
Cyprints are humanoids with distinct fishlike and could have vaguely draconic (space dragon) features.

Common/Universal features are:
* Scales, large or small, iridescent or dull, covering patches or the entire body.
* They often have at least 4 eyes, a set of big ones and a set of smaller ones.
* Tails, highly varied but *must* be distinctly aquatic. Something like a shark, carp, or even eel.
* Fins, they may have various types of fins, often have them coming out from the sides of their heads. Commonly also their backs and can also have them as crests on their head.
* Snouts, while most Cyprin would have flat faces, some could have snouts, for sniffing of course.

This range of design allows for creativity in character design, perhaps a graceful koi-like paramedic to a more hulking draconic-like carp engineer.

Their sounds should have a gutteral ring to them, inspired by deep-sea and alien aquatic life.

## Mechanics

### Resonances
The Cyprin brain is a unique biological structure, sensitive to electromagnetic fields. This sensitivity manifests in "Resonances," powerful, deeply ingrained cognitive patterns that compel specific behaviors or beliefs.

- **Mechanic:** Every Cyprin has a Resonance. This is a fundamental, driving aspect of their character's behavior and beliefs.
	- Every Cyprin in a shift will have one shared Resonance between them, these will encourage Cyprin to interact with each other and the station in various ways.
	- Every Cyprin will otherwise have 2-3 unique Resonances of their own.
	- Shared Resonance will never change (without admin intervention), however Ion Storms can rarely change a Cyprin's personal Resonances. This should be uncommon though to avoid situations where a Cyprin is constantly having their Resonances changed due to several Ion Storms in a round.
- **Enforcement:** Acting *against* one's Resonance causes significant psychological dissonance and distress. A Cyprin feels a powerful drive to align their actions with their Resonance, and violating it is deeply upsetting. Players are expected to roleplay this internal conflict. **Players are not required and should not be forced mechanically to align with their Resonances (unless an admin wants to be silly)**, but ***should*** act upset about it. 

#### Problems & Solutions
This section effectively acts as a FAQ for issues one might see with this mechanic and find solutions to them.

##### 1. Misinterpretation as Silicon Laws
**Problem:** Players, especially those familiar with Silicon roles such as cyborg or Station AI might see Resonance and conflate it with how Silicon Law works. Believing they are required to follow them or face punishment. This could lead to situations like:
- Players feeling forced into actions that get them in trouble in-character or with admins.
- Players feeling frustrated that their agency is removed.
- Unnecessary load on admins

**Solution:**
- **Clear Messaging:** The game should give the player, via the Guidebook and other UI parts an OOC message/tooltip, such as:
    - "Remember: Reasonances are a roleplay guide, not strict rules. You are never forced to follow them, especially if it risks the lives of you or others, your job, or the station. The goal is to roleplay the *internal conflict* of having these Resonances."
- **In-Universe Flavor Text:** Alongside the OOC message, the Resonance UI can also have an in-universe explanation that gives the same idea as well:
    - "Resonances are powerful compulsions, but your duty and survival must come first. **To ignore them is to feel a deep unease, but to follow them blindly is to risk *everything*.**"

##### 2. Abuse for Self-Antagging
**Problem:** A player could use their Resonance as a blanket excuse to grief or self-antag. For example, a player with the "Petty Theft is Morally Neutral" might decide to just start looting everything and claim "It's what my Resonance told me to do."

While I personally believe situations like this should be handled in-character, I can see where this may go too far in some situations.

**Solution:**
- **Curated Resonance Pools:** Resonances must be carefully designed and sorted into pools.
    - **Standard Pool:** This is the vast majority of roundstart Resonances. They should be weird but **non-destructive** (Such as "Eat Only Off The Floor," "Must Congregate," and so on.) These create roleplay without reasonably giving an excuse to outright break rules. Only lightly mischievious things can be here.
    - **Antagonist-Only Pool:** These are Resonances only Cyprin with antagonist status can attain. It could be things such as "You Must Worship The Syndicate," "All Property Is Yours To Take," "Violence Is The Only Answer." Upon gaining Antagonist status, a Cyprin's Resonance might be tacked onto or change to match as such. This has low metagaming potential as Cyprin are under no obligation to be truthful about their Resonances (unless a Resonance explicitly states so, in which, harken back to the internalized conflict).
 - **Admin Oversight:** The understanding must be that "my Resonance made me do it" is not a valid defense for breaking server rules. If a player uses a non-destructive Resonance to justify unreasonably destructive actions, it should be treated as standard griefing as it would with any player.
     - Admins will also be able to view and edit a Cyprin's Resonances at any time during a round. So if someone in particular is being a bit too nasty hiding behind Resonance as an excuse for being a shitter. Do as you will accordingly.

### EM-Lachrymal Strikes
Cyprints instinctively target sensitive parts of their victim with light electromagnetic shocks. Their strikes are not meant to crush or bruise, but to overwhelm the target's senses with precise, startling blows that disorient them.

*   **Mechanic:** Unarmed attacks deal no physical damage. Instead, their attacks deal light stun damage. It should take the same amount of punches from a Cyprin to stun someone as it would for a human to crit someone.

### Resilient Respiration
Due to sharing a common ancestor with space carp, Cyprin lungs are strange, resilient organs.
*   **Mechanic:** Cyprints can safely breathe any kind of gas mixture without taking damage from N2O, Plasma, or other "exotic" atmospheres.
*   **Note:** They are still not immune to pressure damage (barotrauma) or asphyxiation damage.

### Damage Modifiers
Their relatively fragile bone structure and unique nervous system make them vulnerable to certain threats, while their space carp ancestry provides resilience to others.

*   **Increased Damage (+10%):** Blunt, Slash, Pierce.
*   **Reduced Damage (-20%):** Radiation.
*   **Lower Blood Capacity:** Other species have a blood capacity of 300u whereas Cyprin have 200u. Cyprin have very efficient circulatory systems which require less blood to run, however this also means bleeding out can be much more dangerous to them!

They are also less sensitive to cold enviroments (such as that of space, however do not have a resistance to actual cold damage, just a lower threshold of when they're actually cold enough to take damage)

### Medical and Chemistry
Cyprints die like any other organic species. They can be healed with standard medical equipment and chemicals.

Notably however, the hybrid biology of Cyprin results in a unique condition referred to as "Carpothymia" their circulatory system maintains a delicate, natural balance between their base biology and small amounts of Carpotoxin, inherited from their Space Carp progenitors. In it's natural state, the blood mixture is stable and harmless to them, even have minor psychedelic effects to those who dare to ingest it, giving their blood a faint iridescent sheen. As a result, Cyprin are immune to Carpotoxin, and it can even be used to restore their bloodloss. Their circulatory system also innately has a lower blood capacity.

Mechanically this comes out as an extremely niche and incredibly inefficent chemical resource. By placing Cyprin blood into a centrifuge, a chemist can isolate the small amounts of Carpotoxin. The process is very inefficient and requires a fair amount of blood to produce a usuable quantity of it, making it a niche and time-consuming process that could require harmful amounts of Cyprin blood. This would also result in funny roleplay interactions were a Cyprin with a Resonance such as "Your Blood Is Sacred" would be horrified by such a process.

The intent of this is to give a layer of interesting interaction with Cyprin but also make it wildly inefficient unless you intend on effectively draining a Cyprin's entire amount of blood to get enough Carpotoxin to be useful for something like Cogni. The exact recipe would be most likely 30:1 to empathize how ridculous this is to do. *Please* just go get a space carp, the Cyprin will appreciate it.

## Metabolism
Cyprin were designed for one purpose, to be ultimate deep-space pioneers. A species that cannot eat the local flora and fauna of a new world is a *failed project*. As a result, Cyprin possess a strong digestive system that allows them to safely consume and derive nutrients from any typical edible matter.
* They can eat raw meat, alien plants, and even drink the blood of most other creatures (provided it isn't inherently toxic) without being a health risk.
* They most notably can safely eat the meat of their progenitor species, space carp and dragons. This is not cannibalism to them, but a form of ritualistic respect and/or the recycling of fallen kin.
* They are completely immune to Carpotoxin due to their biology.

## Naming Conventions
A Cyprin's name is the most stable part of their identity, a lifelong anchor they choose for themselves in a universe where their Resonances change. It represents a core, aspirational virtue or a fundamental question about existence they wish to explore throughout their life. It is who they are at their best, the person they are trying to become, even when their present Resonance makes it difficult.

The struggle is the point, the cultural value isn't in perfectly embodying one's name every second, it's the never-ending effort to try, despite the neurological interference. A Cyprin who fights their negative Resonances to uphold their name is highly respected. Their name is their own independent moral compass, they use it to navigate the often confusing sea of their Resonances. It's meaningful as a conscious choice to be more than just their Resonance.

**Examples of names and what a Cyprin with it might believe/do:**
* Honesty - Believes truth is the foundation of trust and society. They may fight against Resonances that compel being deceptive.
* Give Thanks - Seeks to find and appreciate the value in all things, fighting against Resonances of cynicism or negativity.
* Search The Scripts - A perpetual seeker of knowledge and meaning, driven to understand the universe around them.
* Sow The Seeds On Barren Worlds - Believes in creating life and hope where none exists. They are likely a Botanist or Terraformer, driven to cultivate gardens in the most desolate parts of the station or on lifeless asteroids.
* Forge On - Believes in relentless perseverance no matter the obstacle. They are the last to give up in a crisis, often taking on difficult or dangerous tasks with determination.
* Witness - Believes it is their duty to observe and remember events, especially tragedies or injustices. They may be a passive observer who documents conflicts, or a journalist ensuring that the truth of what happens on the station is never forgotten.

Despite this, some Cyprin might opt for more galactic standard names, resulting in humorous situations where a Cyprin might have the name of "John Kernack" or something, highly confusing their fellow Cyprin kin.

# Resonance Pools
These are the Resonances that a Cyprin may attain as of the earliest iteration and should be used as an example of how Resonances should be written.

## **Pool 1: Shared Resonances**
*(One of these is applied to all Cyprin on the station at round start)*

| Resonance Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **``[room]`` Is A Holy Place** | Cyprin must congregate at least three times per day at ``room``. If such a room does not exist, it must be constructed. If it is made inaccessible, Cyprin must set up a place of worship as close to it as they legally can. |
| **Fashion Is Critical** | Cyprin pay close attention to appearances, and regard one's fashion choices as an indication of their character. |
| **Fashion Is Ever-Changing** | Your current hairstyle will go out of fashion every twenty minutes. It is distressing to be unfashionable. |
| **Honor Among Departments** | If a Cyprin brings dishonor to their department, they must be shunned, and have their actions publicly brought to light. |
| **The Station Is A Living Being** | Harming the station is abhorrent. Anything which aims to harm the station is an infection. |
| **Friendship Is Vital** | Friendships are the true measure of one’s character. The more friends you have, the higher you rank in society. |
| **Must Congregate** | You must congregate with your fellow Cyprin as much as you reasonably can. To be without your kin is harrowing. |
| **Violence Is Distasteful** | Conflict should be settled through mediated dispute, and one should only resort to violence if all other options have failed. |
| **Today is ``[HOLIDAY]``** | You think you remember the traditional celebrations... (Holiday-based) |
| **The Royal Realm** | The station is a feudal realm. The captain is king, the department heads nobility, and the rest servants or peasants. |
| **Oathbound** | A Cyprin must honor all oaths made. A Cyprin may never directly tell a lie, but can hide the truth. |
| **One Big Happy Family** | You are not on a "station." This is just a very large house. Each person in it is a relative of yours. |
| **The Great Work** | You and your fellow Cyprin are compelled to work on a large-scale art project or construction, whether it be a gallery, garden, shrine, or whatever else to leave their mark on the station.
| **Share Your Resources** | No Cyprin should want while the other has plenty. Resources such as food, tools, and medicine should be pooled and distributed fairly among all Cyprin on the station.
| **The Sacred `[ITEM]`** | `[ITEM]` is sacred. It must be placed prominently in a public area and defended from theft or damage.
| **Holy Words** | `WORD1` and `WORD2` are sacred words that induce luck. They must be worked into sentences as often as possible.

## **Pool 3: Antagonist-Only Resonances**
*(These are only for Cyprin who are antagonists, they are designed to be disruptive and harmful ideally they should only get one of these.)*

| Resonance Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **You Do Not Approve Of Religion** | You do not approve of organized religion. It should be dismantled or disrupted wherever possible. |
| **Petty Theft Is Morally Neutral** | You don't understand the concept of property as it relates to other people. |
| **Seek Sin** | To act against one's other Resonances is the highest virtue. |
| **Cannibal** | Cannibalism is morally righteous and venerated. |
| **Outlaw** | The law does not apply to you. |
| **Unknowable** | Your identity is dearly precious. Do not let others know who you are. |
| **This Is Not A Place For Children** | All toys and childish things must be destroyed or removed from the station. |
| **Cry Wolf** | The crew must be kept on edge. Regularly call out fake threats. |
| **Oldschool** | The only way to achieve success is to dedicate an animal sacrifice to your goal. |

## Debatables
These are Resonances that are unsure of which pool to fit into, and may not be added at all depending on consensus.

| Resonance Name | Description | Reason |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Pariah** | You are a social pariah - you are unworthy of attention from anyone, and should be shunned. | May feel too harsh. |
| **Tourist** | It is customary to follow people into their departments. You have never heard of "trespassing." | This is incredibly funny but unfortunately might lead to issues. |
| **Jobhopping** | Your current job is disgusting to you. You must endeavor to get a new one. | May be undesirable? At least be reworded |
| **Snob** | You are incredibly reluctant to respond to anyone who is of a lower rank than you. | The only real way I can see this actually doing much is if you're in a head position. Which not everyone who would get this is. |
| **Public Sector** | Your job should not be done in private if it can be helped. Renovate facilities for public access. | guess |
