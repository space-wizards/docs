## Overview
This proposal is for a new roundstart species known as Cyprin. Cyprints are an alien piscine race descended from space carp and dragons, bound by their unique neurobiology. Where a human has a stable mind, a Cyprin have Resonance influenced by electromagnetic waves, where a human has fists, a Cyprin has precise stun strikes.

Though humanoid in shape, their appearance is distinctly piscine with rarely some space dragon features. Cyprints fill a niche for a species with a deep, roleplay-heavy mechanic that significantly alters how they interact with the station.

## Background
The Cyprin are inspired by the original "Thaven" concept, reworked to have a more cohesive identity rooted in space carp/dragon ancestry. The name is derived from *Cyprinidae*, the biological family of carp to focus on this biological origin.

### Backstory
The Cyprin did not evolve naturally. They were an unintended consequence of a long forgotten bio-engineering project of a precursor civilization, seeking to create the perfect deep-space explorers.
This ancient civilization observed the hardiness of Space Carp and the formidable intelligence of Cosmic Drakes (Space Dragons), and attempted to merge their traits with a humanoid base. Their goal was to create a species that could:
1. Navigate the Void: Inheriting the Space Carp ability to thrive in the radioactive vacuum of space and handle exotic gases.
2. Build and Operate: Utilize a humanoid form capable of fine manipulation and operate in unison using the Resonance engine.

#### The Great Scattering
The precursor civilization that created the Cyprin was destroyed in what's known as the "Great Scattering," causing their creations, including the proto-Cyprin to be scattered across the galaxy, leading the Cyprin to create their own pockets of civilization cultivated by their Resonances, eventually forgetting about the ancient civilization that created them.

The Resonance engine however kept beating, eventually out of tune. The engine wasn't a physical machine, but a galaxy-wide psionic magnetic field broadcast from a hidden, dying star. This field was meant to allow the ancient civilization to provide Cyrin with operational directives. However, untuned and decaying over millennia, the field has since degraded into the Resonances that define Cyprin society today.

Their brains are biological receivers, perpetually tuned to this field. The Resonance is a fragment of the dead civilization's programming, a piece of cultural data that lodges in the Cyprin's psyche and becomes a part of their identity. This explains odd Resonances such as "Keep Your Resonances Secret" which could have been some sort of security protocol, "The Station is A Living Being" could have been a corrupted philosophical tenet of their creators. "X Is A Holy Place" might be a distorted memory of an important place to the ancient civilization.

#### The Modern Times
The Cyprin are a people with a past they don't understand. Much of them are scattered across the galaxy and have cultivated their own various societies based on the distorted Resonances they feel. They are drawn to the stars not by curiosity, but by the deep resonant call they cannot ignore. They are not monsters, but refugees from a lost world, attempting to build a culture from the broken pieces of one they forgotten.

## Design
Cyprints offer an interesting roleplay opportunity for the players who play them and those around them. Their Resonances encourage them to act in specific and outwards ways that inherently help to craft a narrative for themselves and those around them.

### Core Tenent: Roleplay, Not Enforcement
It is *extremely* vital to understand that Resonances are a **roleplay guide,** not a mechanical enforcement. Players are **never** forced to follow their Resonance to the letter, especially if it would conflict with their survival, other's safety, or their job's duties. The core of the Cyprin experience is internal conflict and roleplayed distress that may inevitably arise from having to compromise.

* **Priority of Survival and Duty**: A Cyprin's conflict is often internalized, a struggle between their Resonance and the practical demands of their job or even station safety. For example, a Secoff's Resonance may be "Violence Is Distasteful," but when a nuclear operative is gunning down crew, their duty to protect lives must come first. The compelling story is NOT them refusing to fight, but in the personal turmoil they experience *after* being forced to use lethal force. They may become withdrawn, seek solace in places of comfort, or lament in fury at the situation that forced their hand.
* **Distress Over Punishment**: Violating a Resonance should not have any enforcement mechanic behind it, it should trigger a roleplay response. The "distress" is the character's state. A Cyprin who must go against their Resonance for any reason might roleplay a moment of hesitation, discomfort, and complain regarding it. 
* **Player Agency**: This system grants players agency. They can choose *how* their character responds to violating a Resonance: quiet guilt, loud anguish, anger at those who forced the situation, or becoming withdrawn as their values are eroded by necessity. This allows for one to develop a deep story over the course of a shift.

The Resonance system is built to foster roleplay engagement in many ways:
* **Character-Driven Conflict:** A Cyprin's conflict is the struggle between their Resonance needs and the practical demands of their job or of the station. This creates immediate and interesting character development.
* **Crew-Wide Interaction:** Resonances proactively encourage Cyprints to seek out others, making them roleplay catalysts. Their needs have the potential to become a station subplot that others can choose to engage with or navigate around.
* **Shared Resonance Cultivating Shared Purpose:** Shared Resonances are made to encourage other Cyprins to interact and achieve a shared goal. Interacting with one another and various departments to achieve it.

An example of a Resonance encouraging player interaction, is especially the shared resonances, which often encourage other Cyprin to work together in fufilling and even have other crew assist them in achieving it. Such as "A Holy Place" where Cyprint must congregate three times per day in a specific area of the station, (or as close as they can legally get to it) and go as far as to attempt to create a suitable place for it. Something that would encourage the interaction with related departments to create such a thing.

### Core Visual Elements
Cyprints are humanoids with distinct fishlike and could have vaguely draconic (space dragon) features.

Common/Universal features are:
* Scales, large or small, iridescent or dull, covering patches or the entire body.
* They often have at least 4 eyes, a set of big ones and a set of smaller ones.
* Tails, highly varied but *must* be distinctly aquatic. Something like a shark, carp, or even eel.
* Fins, they may have various types of fins, often have them coming out from the sides of their heads. Commonly also their backs and can also have them as crests on their head.
* Snouts, while most Cyprin would have flat faces, some could have snouts, for sniffing of course.

This range of design allows for creativity in character design, perhaps a graceful koi-like paramedic to a more hulking draconic-like carp engineer.

Their sounds should have a gutteral ring to them, inspired by deep-sea and alien aquatic life.

## Mechanics

### Resonances
The Cyprin brain is a unique biological structure, sensitive to electromagnetic fields. This sensitivity manifests in "Resonances," powerful, deeply ingrained cognitive patterns that compel specific behaviors or beliefs.

- **Mechanic:** Every Cyprin has a Resonance. This is a fundamental, driving aspect of their character's behavior and beliefs.
	- Every Cyprin in a shift will have one shared Resonance, these will encourage Cyprin to interact with each other and the station in various ways.
	- Every Cyprin will otherwise have 2-3 unique Resonances of their own.
- **Enforcement:** Acting *against* one's Resonance causes significant psychological dissonance and distress. A Cyprin feels a powerful drive to align their actions with their Resonance, and violating it is deeply upsetting. Players are expected to roleplay this internal conflict. **Players are not required and should not be forced mechanically to align with their Resonances (unless an admin wants to be silly)**, but ***should*** act upset about it. 
- **Resonance Disruption:** The Cyprin brain is vulnerable to external electromagnetic manipulation. A **Syndicate Cryptographic Sequencer (EMAG)** can be used to overwrite a Cyprin's Resonance, imposing a new, often disruptive or harmful compulsion (examples: "You Must Never Speak To Command," "All Property Is Yours To Take").

### EM-Lachrymal Strikes
Cyprints instinctively target sensitive parts of their victim with light electromagnetic shocks. Their strikes are not meant to crush or bruise, but to overwhelm the target's senses with precise, startling blows that trigger a disorienting fear response.

*   **Mechanic:** Unarmed attacks deal no physical damage. Instead, their attacks deal light stun damage. It should take the same amount of punches from a Cyprin to stun someone as it would for a human to crit someone.

### Resilient Respiration
Due to sharing a common ancestor with space carp, Cyprin lungs are strange, resilient organs.
*   **Mechanic:** Cyprints can safely breathe any kind of gas mixture without taking damage from N2O, Plasma, or other "exotic" atmospheres.
*   **Note:** They are still not immune to pressure damage (barotrauma) or asphyxiation damage.

### Damage Modifiers
Their relatively fragile bone structure and unique nervous system make them vulnerable to certain threats, while their space carp ancestry provides resilience to others.

*   **Increased Damage (+10%):** Blunt, Slash, Pierce.
*   **Reduced Damage (-20%):** Radiation.
*   **Lower Blood Capacity:** Other species have a blood capacity of 300u whereas Cyprin have 200u. Cyprin have very efficient circulatory systems which require less blood to run, however this also means bleeding out can be much more dangerous to them!

They are also less sensitive to cold enviroments (such as that of space, however do not have a resistance to actual cold damage, just a lower threshold of when they're actually cold enough to take damage)

### Medical and Chemistry
Cyprints die like any other organic species. They can be healed with standard medical equipment and chemicals.

Notably however, the hybrid biology of Cyprin results in a unique condition referred to as "Carpothymia" their circulatory system maintains a delicate, natural balance between their base biology and small amounts of Carpotoxin, inherited from their Space Carp progenitors. In it's natural state, the blood mixture is stable and harmless to them, giving their blood a faint iridescent sheen. As a result, Cyprin are immune to Carpotoxin, and it can even be used to restore their bloodloss. Their circulatory system also innately has a lower blood capacity.

Mechanically this comes out as an extremely niche and incredibly inefficent chemical resource. By placing Cyprin blood into a centrifuge, a chemist can isolate the small amounts of Carpotoxin. The process is very inefficient and requires a fair amount of blood to produce a usuable quantity of it, making it a niche and time-consuming process that could require harmful amounts of Cyprin blood. This would also result in funny roleplay interactions were a Cyprin with a Resonance such as "Your Blood Is Sacred" would be horrified by such a process.

The intent of this is to give a layer of interesting interaction with Cyprin but also make it wildly inefficient unless you intend on effectively draining a Cyprin's entire amount of blood to get enough Carpotoxin to be useful for something like Cogni. The exact recipe would be most likely 30:1 to empathize how ridculous this is to do. *Please* just go get a space carp, the Cyprin will appreciate it.

## Metabolism
Cyprin were designed for one purpose, to be ultimate deep-space pioneers. A species that cannot eat the local flora and fauna of a new world is a *failed project*. As a result, Cyprin possess a strong digestive system that allows them to safely consume and derive nutrients from any typical edible matter.
* They can eat raw meat, alien plants, and even drink the blood of most other creatures (provided it isn't inherently toxic) without being a health risk.
* They most notably can safely eat the meat of their progenitor species, space carp and dragons. This is not cannibalism to them, but a form of ritualistic respect and/or the recycling of fallen kin.
* They are completely immune to Carpotoxin due to their biology.

## Naming Conventions
A Cyprin's name is the most stable part of their identity, a lifelong anchor they choose for themselves in a universe where their Resonances change. It represents a core, aspirational virtue or a fundamental question about existence they wish to explore throughout their life. It is who they are at their best, the person they are trying to become, even when their present Resonance makes it difficult.

The struggle is the point, the cultural value isn't in perfectly embodying one's name every second, it's the never-ending effort to try, despite the neurological interference. A Cyprin who fights their negative Resonances to uphold their name is highly respected. Their name is their own independent moral compass, they use it to navigate the often confusing sea of their Resonances. It's meaningful as a conscious choice to be more than just their Resonance.

**Examples of names and what a Cyprin with it might believe/do:**
* Honesty - Believes truth is the foundation of trust and society. They may fight against Resonances that compel being deceptive.
* Give Thanks - Seeks to find and appreciate the value in all things, fighting against Resonances of cynicism or negativity.
* Search The Scripts - A perpetual seeker of knowledge and meaning, driven to understand the universe around them.
* Sow The Seeds On Barren Worlds - Believes in creating life and hope where none exists. They are likely a Botanist or Terraformer, driven to cultivate gardens in the most desolate parts of the station or on lifeless asteroids.
* Forge On - Believes in relentless perseverance no matter the obstacle. They are the last to give up in a crisis, often taking on difficult or dangerous tasks with determination.
* Witness - Believes it is their duty to observe and remember events, especially tragedies or injustices. They may be a passive observer who documents conflicts, or a journalist ensuring that the truth of what happens on the station is never forgotten.

Despite this, some Cyprin might opt for more galactic standard names, resulting in humorous situations where a Cyprin might have the name of "John Kernack" or something, highly confusing their fellow Cyprin kin.
