## Overview

Beefmen are quick, neurotic and creepy humanoids. They have amazing powers of regeneration to make up for their weak bodies and broken minds. As they are made from mashed together lumps of meat, their bodies are fairly modular. They aim to find a place to fit in, although it's difficult due to their unsightly appearance and strange ways of thinking. Despite the name, beefmen can any sex and gender of their choosing.

## Background

[Beefmen](https://wiki.fulp.gg/en/beefmen) are based on a race from the SS13 server Fulpstation. Since their lore is rather light, and wouldn't make sense for several reasons, I have taken to liberty to [write my own](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j4_m6cBchubjOlQpeGm5gtYsG2U5BasvOSYI4lDRTKs/edit?usp=sharing), making them survivors of a bluespace incident which had them stuck in a mysterious dimension known as Photober, changing them in ways no one quite understands.

Beefmen are based on an [OneyPlays video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFAA1yPqCvo), although I don't believe he had much involvement in the creation of the species, making it possible to separate the concept from him in case some maintainers wouldn't want SS14 associated with him much.  

I'm looking to not only add a species from Space Station 13 but also add a species with some body horror mechanics.

## Design

### Appearance

Beefmen are tall and lanky humanoids, made of lumps of random meat. Their lack of skin means they have no eyelids or lips. Their bodies are red like uncooked beef although it might be possible to have white or orange characters if we allow use of poultry and fish meat.

Beefmen customization would allow hair and special tattoos called Grillmarks.

If we use the classic SS13 sprites, we may need to make variant clothing sprites. We could also use displacement maps and create a new model based on humans but tall and thin, like elves on april fools.

### Naming

I would like to keep the Beefmen name, although if different types of meat are allowed the name Meatmen or Carnoes might be more fitting. Their "official" name is Photobians but most use the previous options as nicknames like Reptilians for the Unathi.

As for naming schemes, since Beefmen are essentially mutated humans, they are encouraged to use human names with an odd quirk or odd sentences. Example: Michael Michael, Succulent Peterson, Jaaaack Woooods, Whatisthatthing, Bythe Dozen.

### Audio

They would use normal human gasps and screams, but being punched or punching would make a meaty squelching sound.

### Speech

Beefmen speak in all capital letters and cannot use punctuation.

### Abilities Stats and Restrictions

Weak Body
- Beefmen take 120% physical damage and their fists inflict 80% making them weak in unarmed fights.

Cold resistance
- Beefmen are resistant to cold, they do not take cold damage whatsoever as it simply freezes their meat.

Heat Weakness
- Strong heat can cause beefmen fat to melt, leaving them sometimes limbless as their joints just melt away. This only applies to temperature and not fire, beefmen can easily detect hot temperatures as their meat darkens and they become "Cooked".

Photober's Mark
- While Beefmen have returned to the normal world, their mind is still halfway between here and Photober, causing them to see and feel things that other species do not. This can be anything from voices, fake announcements, randomly catching fire or seeing monsters attacking. They have symptoms similar to schizophrenia but I want to avoid as much as possible to create a species offensive to real life schizophrenics. This means a willingness to make symptoms more accurate or make it clearer that Beefmen have a different condition. Beefmen are not really "insane" as much as they are seeing two worlds at once with a mind that can only handle one.

Sleeplessness
- Beefmen, for good or ill, cannot fall asleep. This means an immunity to nocturine, but they also lose the healing effects of using beds and other medicine that causes drowsiness.

Quick speed
- The Beefmen are quick and nimble to make up for their weaknesses.
Ideally should be within the range where it does not invalidate chases, only create an advantage.

Detachable Limbs
- Beefmen can remove their limbs at will, pulling it out of them and turning it into a steak, which is either raw or cooked depending on damage sustained. Beefmen can regenerate these limbs by mashing themselves with meat or meat products like sausages and meatballs. Removing a limb takes away 20% of reagents in the body and reduces max health by 10.

Photober Tears
- Beefmen are able to see small portals on the station that are randomly linked. Using these allows a Beefman to teleport, so long as no organic player has either portal in their line of sight. This means borgs and AIs do not count.

### Game Design Rationale

Beefmen have a lot of gameplay quirks, some of which might be too much to handle. I will cooperate with maintainers to find a middle ground if necessary.

Balancing
- Swapping meat and removing limbs cannot fully heal someone as Beefmen cannot remove their heads or torso.
- Utility. Beefmen have to deal with frequent hallucinations, this means players have to pay extra attention to know what is real and what is not.
- Combat. Beefmen are encouraged to avoid combat, as they are brittle but faster than most. Their detachable limbs allow them to quickly heal damage and go back to the fight, provided they have enough meat.
- Traitor. Their speed and weak body means they are better off running from security than engaging them. Their detachable limbs might allow them to lose their fingerprints. Photober tears possibly allow them to escape from inattentive wardens.

Why these mechanics?
- I'm trying as much as possible to keep gameplay faithful to Fulpstation's beefmen.

Overall, this species in theory should a rather unique addition to the species selection. They're inerently kind of goofy, but their combat weakness help deter players from using them as the pooper species (can you swear on github ?). They have odd mechanics that I think will provide interesting gameplay and roleplay opportunities.
## Roundflow & Player interaction

Presuming that the species will exist in every high pop round, the average round outcome or pacing seem unlikely to change. 

I imagine the biggest impact being misunderstandings related to hallucinations.

## Administrative & Server Rule Impact (if applicable)

Hallucinations might be used as an excuse by some bad actors for self-antagging. Players should be given leeway for things like punching someone else to a reasonable extent.

# Technical Considerations

The limb mechanic will only be possible after a limb system is added to the game. In the meantime, I'd recommend making absorbing meat a doafter that heals brute and burn damage.

# So why add the Beefmen?

- Add a beloved specie from SS13.
- They thematically compliment the meat anomalies and other gross alien things.
- They see the world in a fundamentally different way to other species.
- They offer the beefman player unique options to interact with the game.
- They offer alternative combat strengths and weaknesses for players to use with or against them, making them an enjoyable threat or ally.
- They allow the player to get beefy.
