# Mapping Checklist

{{#template ../../templates/outdated.md}}

```admonish warning
This is an old page, and hasn't been updated in over a year. It does not reflect the current state of the game and should be updated as soon as possible.

Until then, consult other mappers, people with the "Head Mapper" role, and the #cartography discord channel as for what content should be present in your map. **This should not be your sole source of information.**
```

This checklist is a general guide on what items are required for typical SS14 station maps. Small maps and non-standard maps may not be able to fit all the content specified, so use this as general guidelines only.

When necessary, the entity ID will be in brackets if it differs greatly from the name of the item. In most cases, you can just search the name. Names with suffixes such as `[filled]` indicate a variant of an entity.

## Blacklist
The items in the following list should not be placed on maps under any circumstances. Unless you are 100% certain that the item is necessary for your map, do not place it, even if it's in a "hidden" location.

If you do choose to add one of these items, seek permission from a maintainer or the head mapper and specifically mention it in your PR.

- Nuclear Authentication Disk
- Nuclear Authentication Codes
- Items with the `[DEBUG]` suffix
- Items with the `[ADMIN]` suffix
- DAW (Digital Audio Workstation)
- Supersynth
- Dual Port Vents (at your own risk, colouring is a pain and they might not work)
- Traitor uplink items
- Tier 2 and Tier 3 research unlocks
- Romerol, in any form
