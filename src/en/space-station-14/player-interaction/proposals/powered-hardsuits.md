## Overview

Implementation of powered hardsuits to the game, and various NON-INTERCHANGEABLE FEATURES to specific hardsuits for them to better excel at their given job. Hardsuits would not be able to compress, they are not modsuits.

## Background

In Space Station 13 (or at least on tg), hardsuits basically don't exist and are replaced with the atrocity known as modsuits. These suits do the following:
- are extremely portable
- have little to no downsides to wear
- can be easily crafted
- can be loaded up with all sorts of meta equipment
- require power
- are basically all the same (due to "modularity" allowing you to put the meta modules in every single suit)

Hardsuits in Space Station 14 are effectively the polar opposite of this, with the exception of the last point. They are all mostly the same, with the only difference between suits being movement speed and armor. What if that wasn't the case though?

## Hardsuits, EVA, and Void suits

Before I get into the cool ideas of what different spacesuits would do, there should be a few specific classifications for spacesuits, since not everything needs abilities.

### EVA suits
EVA suits would be an abundant and renewable (through cargo) form of space protection. The helmet comes separated and needs to be attached and carried on its own. They provide absolutely zero combat resistances. Movement speed and cold protection varies.
This basically only includes EVA suits, emergency EVA suits, and prisoner EVA suits.
EVA suits with resistances would be counted as voidsuits.

### Voidsuits
Voidsuits would basically function as hardsuits without the fancy tech. They would have no abilities, decent movement speed, and not require power. People such as the captain, paramedic, and CMO would get these. The atmos firesuit would sorta fall under this category despite not being called a voidsuit.
Voidsuits can still have headlamps in the helmet, but these would either use power cells or just have infinite power.

### Hardsuits
Hardsuits are the real techy stuff, the things cool people get. Everything from the engineer hardsuit to the deathsquad hardsuit would be in this category.
Hardsuits would be ginormous items, unable to fit in any bag (except for the RD hardsuit) and would give you an increased movement speed penatly when carried rather than worn. Hardsuits can be turned on when the helmet is deployed, decreasing the movement speed penalty and draining the battery. They should they all should do at least SOMETHING different to justify existing, such as...

## Suit Abilities

Specific hardsuits would have specific abilities that could possibly be seen in SS13 modsuits, but these abilities would be hard-locked to specific suits, rather than being placed on any suit with a module. The abilities could include...

- A basic flashlight on the helmet/suit
- Engi hardsuits giving welding protection
- Engi hardsuits having built-in magboots
- Atmos hardsuits having thermal regulators that when disabled don't protect you from extreme heat
- Mining/luxury hardsuits having built-in appraisal tools on item examination
- HoS/sec hardsuit having a small (2x3?) ammo storage (with a whitelist, maybe use the sec belt one?)
- Clown hardsuit playing music or bike horn sounds
- Blood-red and variants having built-in blood-red magboots or noslips
- Elite hardsuit having a small chance to reflect energy weapons
- Juggernaut hardsuit increasing its damage resistance at the cost of increased energy usage
- Deathsquad hardsuit reflecting ballistic weapons (because screw you lol)

All of these are powerful abilities that either remove the need for other tools, or out-do them entirely and allow for something else to be used in a clothing slot. But they have a cost, that cost being...

## Suit charge

Hardsuits would start the round charged to 100% (how much energy a suit can hold varies), but do not use power cells. Instead they would have to be charged at suit storages. You should be forced to remove your hardsuit in order to charge it, you cannot just jump into a suit storage to use it. Every so often while using your suit, you'll have to stop back at your department to charge them, or ask a nearby department to open up and let you charge with their storages.

This is exists to keep people from wearing them 24/7 like people did with modsuits, using less abilities would drain charge slower, allowing people to disable things when unneeded to conserve power, or just never use them for extended spacesuit time.

Running out of charge would not prevent the suit from protecting you from space, but it would give you major slowdown (think 25%-75% depending on the suit) and entirely prevent you from using ANY abilities. Stored items will be locked inside, magboots will be turned off, and additional armor shields will be disabled.

## Several possible scenarios

I would like to demonstrate the idea behind this proposal and the effects it can have on the game by giving four scenarios where hardsuit abilities interact with the rest of the game as a whole while adhering to the core game design pillars.

- Imagine: An syndicate agent is using an engineering hardsuit for the welding protection ability, they have the plan to deconstruct into the armory to steal from it, so they also wear a pair of sunglasses. They have now attained the abilities of both welding goggles and sunglasses, but due to them leaving the welding goggle ability on after they were done using it, they run out of hardsuit power while fleeing security in space and are either apprehended, or they purchase a blood-red hardsuit/syndicate EVA suit from their uplink on the move. 

- Imagine: An engineer is repairing a major spacing near cargo, but his suit runs out of power. He asks salvage if he can use one of their suit storages to charge, which they allow him to do so by opening the door. While the suit is charging, the salvager walks out of the room, leaving the engineer locked inside cargo to either call for the AI, hope the salvager returns, or repeatedly fail to open the door hoping the QM or a different salvager notices.

- Imagine: Engineering is having trouble managing their suit charge constantly throughout the station during a survival/kessler round, so science constructs various suit storages around the station near commonly damaged areas. Engineering uses them often, but is left vulnerable to having their suit stolen by a tider or the clown due to the public area.

- Imagine: Nukies are taking a very long time to complete their mission, and  their suits begin to run low on power. To conserve charge, they start using their suit abilities less. Possibly including noslips that they didn't otherwise buy allowing the clown to slip them, and turning off lights allowing crew to sneak up on them. Or they decide to take a break and charge their suits at the crew's suit storages, leaving them vulnerable to a surprise attack, or even possibly retreating to their own ship to charge using storages provided there, giving the crew a chance to recover and regroup for a counter-attack.

## Required changes
- Suit storages would now be a machine rather than just a plain closet. Likely with a single slot for a suit so you can't charge 7 at once. 1-2 oxygen tank slots or gas mask slots would be good as well. You should still be able to hide in them though like you can in a closet.
- EVA storage uses closets/lockers instead of suit storages to prevent immediate easy access to hardsuit charging in the middle of the station.
- Ideally armories are mapped with a suit storage for every hardsuit, rather than having some just sitting on a rack, though as long as there's one or two storages it would still suffice.
- Various non-charged suits are renamed to voidsuits (cap suit, cmo suit, basic suit, etc.)
