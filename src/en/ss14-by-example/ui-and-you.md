# UI and You

Or how I learned to stop worrying and love Sheetlets.

```admonish note
The UI system in SS14 has been through several iterations, and many portions of
the codebase are out-of-date with the current UI conventions. When using
existing UIs as reference, please keep the age of the code in mind.

If you find some code that is not up to the current conventions, refactors are
always appreciated!
```

Before learning how it should be done in SS14, it's important to understand how
the engine handles UI. Please reference the
[user interface documentation](../robust-toolbox/user-interface.md) first.

## Okay, but how do I make it fancy?

### `FancyWindow`

`DefaultWindow` is not recommended. Unless you're making your own custom window,
`FancyWindow` should be used in all circumstances. It has additional properties
that integrate with SS14 better than `DefaultWindow`.

The `Stylesheet` property allows a window to receive styling information from a
given stylesheet. Currently, there are the following stylesheets:

-   `Nanotrasen` - The default stylesheet. Used for any standard player-facing
    Uis
-   `System` - Primarily used for admin and sandbox UIs
-   `Syndicate` (COMING SOONâ„¢) - Used for any UIs affiliated with the syndicate

### `StyleClass`

Style classes allow style rules to apply styling to an element. You can give an
element style classes by setting the `StyleClasses` property in XAML.

`Content.Client/Stylesheets/StyleClass.cs`: is a static class that for defining
style class strings that can apply to any UI element. This is to centralize the
location of all available style classes, for ease of access and prevention of
duplicate style classes.

Any style classes that are generic / can be used for more than one element are
defined at the top. For example, the style class `positive` affects `Button`,
`Panel`, and `Label`.

The rest of the style classes are defined for a specific generic UI element.
Some common style classes are as follows:

-   `OpenLeft`: Makes the button flat on its left side
-   `OpenRight`: Makes the button flat on its right side
-   `OpenBoth`: Makes the button flat on both sides; square
-   `LabelSubtext`: Makes the label smaller and a more muted color
-   `LabelKeyText`: Makes the label bold and a highlight color
-   `LabelWeak`: Weak is the opposite of strong; makes the label a more muted
    color

There are many more than this, but if you want to know exactly what a given
label does, its as simple as looking at the field's usages, and reading the
style rule definition.

```admonish tip
In general, if you are doing UI dev, I would recommend using the Rider IDE. It
eats up quite a bit of RAM, but it provides autocomplete in XAML files, a lot
of really nice auto-refactoring and searching features, and very decent git
integration. Give it a shot!

I don't think this is possible in VSCode though if you figure it out leave the
setup here.
```

## Writing Styles

This section concerns style rules. For most UIs, editing these will be
unnecessary, however you should ALWAYS prefer to use style classes instead of
hardcoding colors or resources that could be commonly used.

### All hail the mighty `Sheetlet`

It's important to understand that basically, a stylesheet is a massive list of
every single style rule. Instead of making one giant list of style rules
(because that would be ridiculous... haha... ha....), the responsibility of
chipping into this list is distributed between many Sheetlets. Each Sheetlet
returns a small chunk of style rules, which is agglomerated into the final list
at the end.

```admonish note
Previously every single style rule was in one giant list: `StyleNano.cs`, a 1600
line pit of despair where dreams went to die. It was so gargantuan that it broke
syntax highlighting in IDEs. Do NOT let anything like this happen again.
```

There are, primarily, two types of Sheetlets:

-   **Generic Sheetlets**: These go in `Content.Client/Stylesheets/Sheetlets`.
    These sheetlets concern generic UI elements used in many different UIs, and
    should be written generically to work with any stylesheet.
-   **Specific Sheetlets**: These go along with the `*.xaml` files they are
    associated with. These sheetlets concern UI elements that are specific to a
    single UI, and should be written to work with the specific sheetlets they
    are associated with.

We will go into more detail about the specific conventions to follow for both of
these later.

All sheetlets should have the `[CommonSheetlet]` attribute.

```admonish tip
Do not forget the `[CommonSheetlet]` attribute.
```

### Style Rules

Each style rule has a few different components to it (This will look familiar to
anyone who knows CSS):

**The selector**: This limits the elements that a style rule can affect. This is
made up of a few different parts:

-   `Type`: The type of element this rule affects. Anything inheriting from this
    type will also be affected by this rule. 
-   `StyleClasses`: The classes that the element must have to be affected by
    this rule. The element must have all of these classes to be affected by this
    rule. This can be specified in the XML with the `StyleClasses` property.
-   `StyleIdentifier`: The identifier of the element. This is a unique
    identifier that can be used to target a specific element. This should be
    used sparingly, when there is only one instance of the element that needs to
    be styled in a highly specific manner. There may only be one of these
    specified. This can be specified in the XML with the `StyleIdentifier`
    property.
-   `PseudoClasses`: These are special classes that can be used to target
    elements in a specific state. For example, this is used to style buttons
    differently when hovered or pressed or whatever. These are triggered
    automatically through user interaction.
-   Elements may also be styled based on their parent elements, and all their
    style properties. In the style rule definition, this is done with the
    `.ParentOf(...)` method, and can take advantage of all the same selector
    properties defined above.

Selectors that specify more of these parts are more "specific", and will take
priority over selectors that are less specific. If you want your style rule to
override others, make it more specific.

**The properties**: Any elements matching the selector will then have their
properties modified by the style rule. These are the same properties you would
define in the XAML.

To assist with constructing these style rules, there are helper methods defined
in `Content.Client/Stylesheets/StylesheetHelpers`.

Let's walk through some examples of style rules:

```cs
// you need this using statement to use the helper methods
using static Content.Client.Stylesheets.Redux.StylesheetHelpers;

var rules =
[
    // select any element...
    E()
        // ...with the class "negative"
        .Class(StyleClass.Negative)
        // ...and set its font color to the text color from the negative palette
        .FontColor(sheet.NegativePalette.Text),

    // select any `Label`...
    E<Label>()
        // ...with the class "LabelHeading"
        .Class(StyleClass.LabelHeading)
        // ...and set its font to a bold 16pt font
        .Font(sheet.BaseFont.GetFont(16, FontKind.Bold))
        // ...and its font color to the text color from the highlight palette
        .FontColor(sheet.HighlightPalette.Text)

    // select any `ContainerButton`...
     E<ContainerButton>()
        // ...with the class "button"
        .Class(ContainerButton.StyleClassButton)
        // ...and the class "ButtonSmall"
        .Class(StyleClass.ButtonSmall)
        // ...that is the parent of a `Label`,
        .ParentOf(E<Label>())
        // ...and set that `Label`'s font to an 8pt font
        .Font(sheet.BaseFont.GetFont(8))
];
```

### Death to Hardcoding!

Whenever possible, avoid hardcoding in your style rule definitions to keep them
as reusable / broad as possible. The following systems are designed to help keep
all the definitions in a central location, and your style rules should be
patterns that apply those definitions.

#### `ColorPalette`

There is actually a pretty robust (haha) color palette system to hopefully make
hardcoding colors unnecessary. I created a
[codepen](https://codepen.io/aspiringLich/pen/VwOXdjd?editors=1000) to help
visualize the colors. There are a set of common palettes defined in the
`Palettes` class, and each stylesheet uses these for the following common
palettes that sheetlets reference:

-   `PrimaryPalette`: Used for foreground elements
-   `SecondaryPalette`: Used for background elements
-   `PositivePalette`: A traditionally green palette used to represent success /
    good / full
-   `NegativePalette`: A traditionally red palette used to represent errors /
    bad / empty
-   `HighlightPalette`: Used to highlight headings or important elements

In C#, you access the colors by accessing the properties on the `ColorPalette`
class. From brightest to darkest, the properties are (as of writing) arranged as
so (where lower numbers are darker):

-   `+0`: `Text` `Base`
-   `-1`: `TextDark`, `Element`
-   `-2`: `BackgroundLight`, `PressedElement`
-   `-3`: `Background`
-   `-4`: `BackgroundDark`, `DisabledElement`

The reason why this approach is taken, rather than a simple array of colors, is
for readability. The colors in a palette have specific intended uses, so
representing that intention in your code is important to avoid mistakes and make
code cleaner and readable.

#### `ISheetletConfig`

`ISheetletConfig` is intended to cut down on repeated code by providing shared
functionality and definitions between the stylesheets. Any `Sheetlet` that
requires the values in some instance of `ISheetletConfig` should have a generic
type constraint that requires the `ISheetletConfig` interface.

```cs
[CommonSheetlet] // don't forget `[CommonSheetlet]`!
public sealed class ExampleSheetlet<T> : Sheetlet<T> where T : PalettedStylesheet, IExampleConfig
```

`ISheetletConfig` also serves as a dependency check. When the stylesheets pull
all the sheetlets that have `[CommonSheetlet]`, they will first check that they
satisfy the type constraint before adding the rules to the stylesheet.

```admonish info
A sheetlet failing to satisfy the type constraints of any stylesheet will cause
the game to log an error. If your styles are not showing up, this may be why.
```

#### Resource Access

You should access resources differently in sheetlets. Each stylesheet provides a
list of resource roots to look in, when requesting a resource of a certain type.
For example, the root for `NanotrasenStylesheet` for `TextureResource` is
`/Textures/Interface/Nano`. Any texture requested with `GetTexture` will will
append the provided relative path to the root, and return the texture if it
exists.

This system is built to work with any resource type, though currently only
textures are used in the sheetlets.

### Generic Sheetlets

As stated earlier, generic sheetlets are used for generic UI elements that are
used in many different UIs.

-   You should always select elements with `.Class` and not `.Identifier`.
-   When accessing resources, use the `GetTextureOr` method to get the texture
    and provide a fallback root to use if the texture is not found within the
    stylesheets roots.
-   Avoid manual hardcoding of classes. When referencing classes, please only
    use classes defined on the element being styled (in `StyleClass*`
    properties) or define your own in `StyleClass.cs`.
-   Avoid manual hardcoding of colors. Use the palettes provided by the
    stylesheet to set the colors of elements. There are very few cases where you
    will actually need to manually hardcode a color in a generic sheetlet.
-   If you need to access a resource that is not provided already, please add
    the path to the relevant `ISheetletConfig` or create a new one entirely.

                .Prop(BoxContainer.StylePropertySeparation, 10),
        ];
    }
}
```

### Specific Sheetlets

As stated earlier, specific sheetlets are used for UI elements that are specific
to a single UI. These sheetlets are located with the `*.xaml` file they are
associated with.

-   You should prefer to select elements with `.Identifier` and not `.Class`.
-   Any styles that COULD be used by another UI should be moved to a generic
    sheetlet.
-   Hardcoding is more relaxed, you should still try and avoid it when possible,
    but hardcoding `StyleIdentifier`s is probably fine.
-   If you REALLY need a specific resource and its not worth adding it to an
    `ISheetletConfig` you can access it through `ResCache` as normal.
-   You don't need to do the generic type constraints thing since the sheetlet
    should be specific to a single UI, and thus a single stylesheet.

## Making your own `Stylesheet`

Creating a new stylesheet is not as complicated as writing all the style rules,
since with well written style rules, the Stylesheet is mostly One thing to keep
in mind is how colors are chosen.

The colors are generated using the
[OKLAB color space](https://bottosson.github.io/posts/oklab/), which is better
because something something human eyes something. When you choose new colors for
your stylesheet, it may be helpful to use an
[OKLCH Color Picker](https://oklch.com) and modify an existing color.

The best way to learn how to write UI code is to look at existing code. Some UIs
definitely do some terrible things you should never replicate, but there are
mountains of terrible code in SS14, so this is not abnormal. I cannot teach
familiarity with the internals of this game, but I can give a general overview.

Code you could reference:

-   Robotics Console
-   Reagent Dispenser
-   BatteryMenu

There are a few different parts to any UI. say were working with a entity called
`MyThing`, which we wanted to show a UI for. Heres, generally, what the
structure would look like:

```yaml
Content.Server/MyThing/:
- Systems/:
  - MyThingSystem.cs                # Inherits from `SharedMyThingSystem.cs`
                                    # Takes the messages and makes changes in-world, and takes data from in-world to update the UI state.
Content.Shared/MyThing/:
- Components/:
  - MyThingComponent.cs             # Defines the component for the entity
- Systems/:
  - SharedMyThingSystem.cs          # Controls the appearance data and general shared logic
- SharedMyThing.cs                  # Defines the messages that can be sent between server and client, and the UI state

Content.Client/MyThing/:
- Ui/:
  - MyThingWindow.xaml              # The main window, where the main structure of the UI is defined
  - MyThingWindow.xaml.cs           # Defines behavior for `MyThingWindow.xaml`, reading in inputs and calling `Action`s
  - MyThingBoundUserInterface.cs    # Interfaces with the server, sending messages and updating the UI state
- Systems/:
 - MyThingSystem.cs                 # Inherits from `SharedMyThingSystem.cs`
                                    # Takes appearance data and makes in-world changes to reflect that
```

### Bound User Interfaces

>
> > Predicted BUIs are in:
>
> For networking data:
>
> Option 1 (Preferred). Move the BUI state to component states. Use an existing
> client system / make one to handle updating the BUI upon the state updating
> (use TryGetOpenUi) and upon calling Open in the BoundUserInterface. See
> JukeboxSystem for an example, e.g.
>
> ```cs
> private void OnJukeboxAfterState(Entity<JukeboxComponent> ent, ref AfterAutoHandleStateEvent args)
> {
>     if (!_uiSystem.TryGetOpenUi<JukeboxBoundUserInterface>(ent.Owner, JukeboxUiKey.Key, out var bui))
>         return;
>
>     bui.Reload();
> }
> ```
>
> Option 2. Have the BUI control be a dummy until the state comes in
>
> For UIs: Call TryOpenUi in shared where possible and the client should just
> handle it. Calling it from server will also still work similar to the old
> behavior.
>
> For messages: Use SendPredictedMessage where possible in BUIs. At some point
> this will likely become the default over SendMessage.
>
> Overall: Prefer to use the overloads that take in EntityUids instead of
> ICommonSession, this will make it easier to code NPCs who can interact with
> UIs in future.
>
> >
>
> -   There's a helper under this.CreateWindow<TWindow>() for BUIs that handles
>     disposing + opening + close subscription for you.
> -   There's a method OnProtoReload that gets called on BUIs so you can
>     override and handle it without having to manually subscribe on another

> -   I have cleaned up a lot of BUI code. Windows now just raise events and the

>
> Some notes for future:
>
> -   You should spawn / delete control entities inside of EnteredTree and
>     ExitedTree rather than inside Dispose.
> -   Controls should be able to be constructed with an empty constructor and

>     easier.
> -   All new controls must handle prototype reloading if applicable.
> -   All new controls should prefer to use component states and not BUI states
>     where possible. These work better with prediction and are easier to use.
> -   Controls should be able to handle components disappearing and not rely
>     upon GetComponent<T> everywhere as there are no guarantees the component
>     exists.
