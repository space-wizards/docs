3. Candidates shall be put up for election. All Staff Members may vote anonymously. This step must go on for at least 72 hours.
    - A quorum of 1/3rd of the staff team is required for a vote to be valid.
    - If there are less candidates than there are open then each candidate will have their own Yes or No votes. A majority is needed to succeed.
    - If there are more candidates than there are open positions then candidates will go to an instant runoff election. 
        - In an instant runoff election each voter gets one vote and they rank their candidates from most preferred to least preferred.
        - Winners are decided through a series of "rounds". In each round any candidate who gains a voting power equal to: Number of votes/Number of open seats wins.

        - Once a candidate is eliminated their votes are transferred to each one's next preference.
        - Once a candidate wins their votes are transferred to each one's next preference but their "voting power" is multiplied by 1 - number of votes needed to win / the candidates' voting power.
        - The election is concluded once all seats are filled or all candidates are eliminated.
