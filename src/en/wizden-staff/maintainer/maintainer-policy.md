# Maintainer Policy
This is the policy that all maintainers are expected to follow when it comes to behavior and responsibilities. 

This policy applies in addition to the [General Staff](../staff-policy.md) and [Conflict Resolution](../staff-conflict-resolution.md) Polices.

**Breaking any of these rules will result in disiplinary action being taken**
## Reviews and Feedback
- All maintainers must follow the [PR Review](../maintainer/review-procedure.md) and [Hotfix Procedures](../maintainer/hotfix-procedure.md) when they apply.
- Maintainers should try to the best of their ability, to keep PR authors informed on the status of their PRs.
- Maintainers should keep public criticism of code *constructive* and avoid making comments in regards to the authors of the code. **Harsh but fair** citicism of code is *acceptable*, but criticism of its author is not.
- Maintainers should try to perform code reviews *whenever possible*, getting content into the game is everyone's responsibility.
- If there is a conflict around game design between something in the docs and someone's idea, what is detailed in the documentation takes precedent. If a change to specific documentation is needed, it should be brought up with the respective work group for discussion and changes should be made to the documentation if needed.

## In-game Permissions
- Maintainers can request to be given in game permissions by the admin team.
- Maintainers may only use the permissions they are given for the purposes of debugging issues, and playtesting new features. 
- Maintainers must not **under any circumstances** access any data related to a player's account. The only exception to this is logs from a round for the purposes stated above.
- Maintainers may only host playtests with a Propermin from the admin team who must handle ahelps and log the playtest as an event. 
- Maintainers **must** deadmin while playing.
- **Any violation of the above rules will lead to in-game permissions being indefinitely revoked.**

## Changing Maintainer Policy

- Any Maintainer can propose a change to the Maintainer Policy.
- The proposal must be made in the /Internal/Maintainers/ category on Discourse.
- The proposal must have a vote open for at least 72 hours.
    - This may be extended if there is a significant amount of discussion.
- The proposal must have a supermajority (66%) vote in favor to pass.
- A PR to the Docs repository can be made at any time, even if the vote is still ongoing.
    - If there is an ongoing vote, the PR must not be merged until the vote has concluded.

### Exceptions
- Lead Maintainers can change the policy without a vote if it is an emergency or the change is minor.
    - An emergency is defined as a situation where the policy is causing immediate harm to the project.
    - A minor change is defined as a change that does not significantly impact the responsibilities of Maintainers.
- A vote may be skipped if the change is minor and the Lead Maintainers agree, but the Maintainers must be informed of the change.
- A vote is always required for changing the policy that defines the rules on how Maintainer Policy is changed.
