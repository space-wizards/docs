# Staff Policy
This document aims to create a safe and healthy environment while fostering positive interactions among members of the RobustToolbox and Space Station 14 Projects.
## Code of Conduct
#### This policy applies to all project members, regardless of rank, and is effective only within the scope of the project.
- Respect: Members are expected to interact respectfully with others.
- Zero Tolerance: There is zero tolerance for harassment, discrimination, or victimization. While disagreements are normal, personal attacks and insults are unacceptable.
- Illegal Activity: Engagement in illegal activities, including hacking, theft, or copyright infringement, is strictly prohibited and may lead to immediate disciplinary action.
## Conflict Policy
### Definitions:
- Disagreements: Normal and healthy, indicating collaboration and communication; no intervention needed.
- Conflicts: Occur when disagreements escalate into personal attacks or resentment, disrupting collaboration.
- Escalation: If a disagreement escalates into a conflict that makes any member uncomfortable, those involved or witnessing should contact the Moderation Team or HR to initiate the conflict management procedure.
### Conflict Management Procedure
- Reporting: Members can report conflicts to HR or the Moderation Team.
- Investigation: HR will conduct a confidential investigation, interviewing involved parties as needed.
- Resolution Meeting: A meeting will be arranged to discuss issues and seek resolution.
- Follow-Up: A follow-up will ensure the resolution is upheld and address any ongoing concerns.
## Staff Conflict Resolution Policy
For conflicts specifically involving staff members (Maintainers, Art Directors, Project Managers, or Wizards), refer to the detailed Staff Conflict Resolution Policy. This document outlines the specific procedures for addressing staff conflicts, including immediate reporting, mediation, resolution options, and documentation.
## Policy Violations
Members found in breach—such as through harassment, discrimination, or personal attacks—will face disciplinary actions ranging from warnings to removal from the project. All reports will be taken seriously and investigated promptly, ensuring fairness and confidentiality. Our goal is to maintain a positive environment where all members feel safe and valued.
## Encouragement of Reporting
We encourage all team members to promptly report any policy violations. It is essential to foster a culture of accountability where everyone feels safe to speak up. Reports can be made confidentially, and individuals who come forward will be protected against retaliation.
## Feedback Mechanism
Members are encouraged to provide feedback on this policy to ensure it meets the project's needs. Suggestions for improvement can be submitted anonymously via forums or direct messages to HR members. The HR team will review regular feedback for necessary adjustments.
## Review Schedule
This HR policy will be reviewed annually or sooner if significant issues arise. The HR team will assess its effectiveness and relevance, making updates as needed to reflect changes in team dynamics or project goals. All members will be notified of any revisions.
