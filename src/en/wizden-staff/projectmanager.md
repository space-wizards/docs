# Project Managers

## What are Project Managers (or PMs)?

Project Managers handle a variety of responsibilities when it comes to the SS14 game and community. If there is policy or a high-level decision being made, the project management team will be involved. PM is less of a defined role and more of a higher responsibility with different PMs handling different elements of the game and community. In general if a situation needs escalating then short of involving a Wizard, PMs are where the buck stops so to speak.

The PM team does not appeal bans or get involved in individual player/game disputes unless said dispute is creating an issue of safety or harassment (However some PMs are also game admins and may act in this capacity). The admin team should be your first point of contact for these sorts of issues, with PM's being the nuclear option in an emergency situation where you have fears for your, or another community member's safety.

## Areas of Responsibility

All Project Managers have the same level of authority and autonomy when it comes to addressing issues, however some PMs prefer to or are more experienced in handling particular issues. In an emergency any PM will be able to help you, but generally a PM with the appropriate area will be able to address your issue faster and more accurately. *Although, if you message the wrong PM don't worry we all talk with each other so they'll be able to help you or forward you along to someone who can, it's just faster to start with a PM from that area!*

Here is a list of PM's and their responsibilities. Some responsibilities such as Hub Administration and Sensitive Issue handling are not listed publicly to prevent targeted harassment.
