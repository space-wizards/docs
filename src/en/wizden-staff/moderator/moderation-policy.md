# Moderator Policy

This is the policy that all moderators are expected to follow when it comes to behavior and responsibilities.

This policy applies in addition to the [General Staff](../staff-policy.md) and [Conflict Resolution](../staff-conflict-resolution.md) Polices.

## Core Responsibilities

Outlines the responsibilities of a moderator.

- Enforcing community rules

- Responding to reports made from community members

- Removing and censoring inappropriate content

- Stopping fights and de-escalating situations

- Representing the community in a professional manner

## Policy Violations
Members found in violation of this policy may face disciplinary action, and will be deferred to a Head Moderator.

## Channel naming
As a moderator, you have the ability to change the channel name of the general chat. There are some rules that follow that.

- Always keep the world "general" in the channel name.
- Do not put names of community members in the channel name.
- Keep it appropriate and respectful.
