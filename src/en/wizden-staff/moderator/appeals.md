# Appeals

Users who have been banned may appeal their ban on the forums. Appeals will be reviewed by the moderation team, and a decision will be made on whether to lift the ban or not.

Any member of the moderator group may handle a ban appeal, but appeals involving events that transpired in Russian channels should be handled by russian moderators.

Any moderator handling a ban appeal may hold a vote in the appropriate Discourse category to get opinions from other moderators.

## Appeal process

This is the process for handling the appeal.

1. Review the appeal, deny the appeal if it fits *any* of the following criteria:
    -   Appeal is clearly the output of an LLM such as ChatGPT,
    -  or "Troll appeal" or very low effort appeal that does not address the ban,
    -   or Appeal is made in bad faith, such as a user appealing multiple times for the same ban,
    -  or The appeal is incomprehensible,
    - or The appeal is for a different server other than WizDen,
2. Review the user's case history using `!listcases <userID>`
3. Review the events that led to the ban, including any evidence provided by the user.
4. At the moderator's discretion, they may hold a vote to get a team consensus.
5. Decide on the appeal's outcome.
6. Post a response to the appeal, which must include:
    - The decision on the appeal.
    - The reasoning for the decision.
    - The facts relied on for the outcome.
    - If another appeal is made
    - If applicable, when the user can reappeal. 
7. Implement the outcome
