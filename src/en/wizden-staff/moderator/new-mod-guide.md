# New moderator Guide

This document will attempt to explain the basics of being a moderator for Space Station 14.

# Commands

Moderators have access to a variety of commands to help them moderate the server, including:
-`!ban <userID> <reason>`: Bans a user from the server, will also send a message to them via DM from the bot, unless they do not accept DMs from non friends.


- `!unban <userID>`: Unbans a user from the server, This command should only be used if the person had an accepted ban appeal on the forums.


- `!warn <userID> <reason> <points>`: Issues a warning to a user, this will send them a DM from the bot with the reason for the warning, if a user obtains five warnings, they get kicked from the discord, upon having 10 points, the user gets banned from the discord.


- `!kick <userID> <reason>`: Kicks a user from the server, the user may rejoin at any time.


- `!mute <userID> <time> <reason>`: Gives the user the muted role, preventing them from sending messages in all channels.


- `!unmute <userID>`: Removes the muted role from a user.


- `!modnote <userID> <note>` !mnote also works for this command. Issues a note to that persons account, this is only visible to other moderators, this is good for keeping track of special circumstances with users.


- `!listcases <userID>`: Lists all cases for a user, mutes, warns, notes, and bans. Very helpful command and should be used before taking any action on a user.


- `!softban <userID>`: Softbans a user, this bans and immediately unbans them, purging their messages from the last 24 hours.


- `!tempban <member> <duration of tempban> <days of messages to be deleted> <reason>` Temporarily bans a user for a specified duration, deleting a specified number of days of their messages.


# Discourse

As a moderator, you will have extra permission on discourse, but first to get those new permissions, you need to contact a head game admin or a head moderator to add you to the EN community moderator group on discourse. You will also need to contact PJB to get full moderator powers.

Once you have full moderation powers, you will be able to see some new tabs, such as internal and ban appeal discussions. You should not access data of players information under any circumstances.

You will also be able to moderate posts, such as locking, deleting, and moving posts, you should only do this when necessary, and always try to inform the original poster of why you are taking action on their post.
