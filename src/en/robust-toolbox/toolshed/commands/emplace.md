# Emplace command

The `emplace` command is a command that takes in some enumerable and repeatedly executes a command block while providing some special read-only variables that are local to that command block. The variables that are provided depends on the input type, though the actual value itself is always available via the `$value` variable. In particular, if given entities it will define local variables that give access to some of the properties of that entity including:
* The entity's map coordinates `$wx`, `$wy`
* The entity's prototype `$proto`
* The entity's name `$name`
* The entity's description `$desc`
* Whether the entity is paused `$paused`
Similarly, an `ICommonSession` will provide the session's attached entity `$ent`, username `$name`, and `NetUserId` via `$userid`.

For example, this simple command will just return the y-coordinates of all entities:
```
entities emplace { var $wy } 
```
In general, the `emplace` command is useful if you want to use the properties of entities as the arguments for some other Toolshed command.

# Do command

The `do` command is similar to the emplace command. It takes in some enumerable and a command string, and will then try to repeatedly evaluate the command string (as if it had been typed into the console), possibly after having performed some string replacements.

The `do` command mainly exists for backwards compatibility with non-Toolshed commands, which do not support Toolshed variables. For example, as of the time of writing the `say` command is not a Toolshed command. So if you wanted to make your own character say the positions of all mobs, you would need to use the `do` command:
```
entities with MobState do "say $WX $WY"
```

The possible string replacements differs from the variables made available in the emplace block. In particular, the current value is `$SELF` instead of `$value`. When given an entity, the following string replacements are made:
* `$ID` is replaced with the current EntityUid.
* `$PID` is replaced with the executing player's attached EntityUid.
* `$WX`, `$WY` is replaced with the entity's map coordinates.
* `$LX`, `$LY` is replaced with the entity's local coordinates.
