# Wizards Den MRP Policy

```admonish info
This is the ban policy for Wizard's Den servers. It applies only to our first-party Wizard's Den servers. The admin policy can be found at [Admin Policy](./wizards-den-admin-policy.md)
```

# Definitions
- **Whitelist:** Refers to an account's ability to join Wizard's Den MRP servers.
- **Warning:** A warning is a clear communication from an admin that some behavior is not acceptable. Warnings should always be paired with an account note making note of the warning and behavior.
- **Strike:** A strike is a type of warning that will result in Dewhitelisting should too many be accrued.
- **Dewhitelist:** The removal of an account's ability to join Wizard's Den MRP servers.
- **Permanent Dewhitelist:** A Dewhitelist which prevents a player from applying for a whitelist again in the future.
- **Endorsement:** An endorsement is formal support from a whitelisted player to a non-whitelisted player. An endorsed whitelisted player may have their Whitelist Application accepted even if they do not meet our playtime requirements.
- **Player Report:** A report by a player that does not necessarily allege a violation of the rules, but reports another player for creating experiences that are not consistent with the roleplay standard of MRP.

## Special Punishment Requirements

### Permanent Dewhitelist

A player may only be dewhitelisted permanently if they meet one of the following requirements:
- The player has received 3 prior Dewhitelists in the past 3 months
- The player has received 8 strikes in the past 6 months

### Loss of Endorsement Privileges

Players who are found to be abusing this Endorsement system can lose their Endorsement privileges. The following offenses will result in permanent loss of Endorsement privileges with bolded ones additionally resulting in Dewhitelistment:
- Endorsing players who frequently break MRP rules
- **Selling/trading Endorsements(in any form)**
- **Attempting to endorse raiders**
- Endorsing low-effort applications
- **Endorsing alternate accounts**

# MRP Punishment Guidelines

```admonish info
Administrators are not required to follow the punishments suggested by the punishment guidelines when taking action against a whitelisted player, but actions taken within the guidelines are presumed to be of appropriate.
```

```admonish info
All instructions in the subsections of the *MRP Punishment Guidelines* section only refer to the guidelines, not policy. A statement saying "X is not permitted" means it is not permitted under the guidelines, not that it may never be done.
```

```admonish warning
Administrators who act outside of the guidelines are required to be able to justify the decision to the admin team.
```

```admonish info
Consulting the admin team via Discord, or consulting multiple (2 or more) other game admins in-game through admin chat or ahelp does not result in those actions being presumed to be of appropriate, but is sufficient justification for straying from the guidelines.
```

[^clarification-1-lawyering]: Rules Lawyering is defined as arguing over a rule. _Politely_ reminding a fellow player of a rule, or asking for quick clarification is acceptable. Getting into lengthy discussions about them is not.

[^clarification-2-slurs]: Slurs, bigotry, and/or discrimination of any kind can, and are encouraged to, result in an immediate dewhitelisting if multiple instances happen in a single round/report.

[^clarification-3-siliconminor]: A minor failure to follow Silicon laws is considered to have occurred when the player misinterprets a law in a way that does not result in a subsequent rulebreak, or in a way that otherwise impacts the round in a largely meaningful way.

[^clarification-4-siliconmajor]: A major failure to follow Silicon laws is considered to have occurred when the player ignores a law, either on purpose or accident, that results in subsequent rulebreaks or disruption of the round in a significant, or largely meaningful way
    
[^clarification-5-ockick]: Unlike the banning policy, exemptions will not be made for teaching new players using OOC on MRP. Quick instances of informing controls may be excused, however teaching game mechanics, departmental duties, etc, should all be taught in-game in-character on MRP.

[^clarification-6-badfaith]: An action is able to be considered "bad faith" if there is no *reasonable* way for the action to be performed with good intentions. It is not required for the person to *actually* be acting in bad faith, only that it is unreasonable for the person to be acting with good intentions.

[^clarification-7-abandoning]: This includes frequently disconnecting from an important role, frequently cryoing after roundstart, failing to perform the duties of a role, and/or taking steps to prevent your role from being possible.

[^clarification-8-rdmescalation]: Guideline may be increased based on the number of victims up to a maximum of 3 strikes/dewhitelisting.

[^clarification-9-secondaryrdm]: This should be used in cases where there are deaths resulting from a station sabotage offense.

## Examples

```admonish info
These examples may be outdated due to an mrp policy update. Please point out any issues if you notice them.
```

### Example 1

A player witnesses a rulebreak, and uses LOOC to alert the offender about it. The offender then kills them, and gibs them. After taking a ghost role, the first player finds the rule breaker and starts attacking them unprompted.

The first player’s offenses are:

    Rules Lawyering
    LOOC arguing
    New Life Rule

They can receive the following:

    A warning for LOOC arguing, and Rules Lawyering
    A strike for violating New Life Rule

The player now has 1 strike. Further punishments can be issued per the Banning Policy.

### Example 2

A player has 1 strike from 2 previous attempts at Rules Lawyering. They bring a canister of plasma onto the evac shuttle, and release it at CentCom. When questioned, they admit they planned it from the start of the round.

Their offenses are:

    EORG

They can receive the following:

    1 strike, all the way up to dewhitelisting for planning to EORG from the start of round

## Applying Strikes

To apply a strike, place a note on the player in the following format:

Round <#>. <offense> Strike. <description>

For example: Round 12345. Role Abandonment Strike. Player abandoned role as botanist after being told they couldn't grow seventy bajillion potatoes

Strikes should always be of medium severity, and set to last for three months. Once expired, they should no longer count towards dewhitelisting, except in exceptional circumstances. Offenses that count as multiple strikes should include that they are being issued as such, for example:

`... This strike is issued as two strikes due to severity`


## Player Reports

Players may submit a report against another player for not following MRP standards. Admins are not required to act on player reports, and may at their discretion ignore them if they don't believe the player being reported is causing issues. Player reports are to be handled as follows:

1. Verify the incident details
2. Check if any rulebreaks occurred
    - Rulebreaks supersede Player-Driven reports, and can be treated as normal
3. Check for any additional reports from other players
    - If this is the only report, allow 2 hours for other reports to be submitted
    - If 2 hours have passed since this report has been submitted, and no other reports have been made, proceed to step 4
    - If additional reports are made within 2 hours, extend the timeframe for reports until no reports are made until either 2 hours from the initial report, or 30 minutes after the last report - whichever is longer
4. If no rulebreaks have occurred, then consult the below table
5. Place the appropriate note on the user’s account.
    - If this results in dewhitelisting, it should include a message notice to inform the player as well.

|                 | 1 - 3 Reports | 3 - 6 reports | 6 - 10 reports | 10+ reports |
|---------------- | --------------| ------------- | -------------- | ------------|
| First Offense   | W - S         | S             | S - DW         | DW          |
| Second Offense  | S             | S - DW        | DW             |             |
| Third Offense   | S - DW        | DW            |                |             |
| Fourth Offense  | DW            |               |                |             |

# MRP Whitelist Application Handling

Whitelist Applications are to be processed as follows:


1. If the application contains any of the following, immediately deny the application:
       - Low-Effort Name
       - Using AI to generate backstory
       - Providing WizDen hours
       - Not providing server name if “proof of hours” is provided
       - User has applied within the last 2 weeks already
2. If the player has a endorsement on their application, verify that there is a note on both their account and the account of the vouching player. If either one is missing, deny the whitelist request for an incomplete endorsement. Otherwise, skip to step 4. An endorsement does not bypass the waiting period between applications.
3. If the account age or playtime are not 2+ weeks and 20+ hours respectively deny the Application
4. Check the account for recent use of slurs, if any are found deny the application.
5. Check the Account for relevant notes/bans.
6. If any are found do any of the following:
    - If the notes/bans do not seem to indicate that the player would cause an issue on MRP continue.
    - If you are unsure then call a vote. If the vote fails deny the application.
    - If you believe the notes/bans indicate the player would be an issue on MRP deny the application.
7. Accept the Application.

# MRP Rule Amendments 

Amendments to MRP rules have to go through the following process:
1. A proposed amendment first needs to go through an admin team vote
    - Discussion must last at least 72 hours.
    - A vote must run for at least 24 hours.
    - An amendment needs to approved via a 75% majority.
2. If approved the amendment will be implemented on a provisional basis. 
3. 2 weeks after the amendment begins being enforced it shall go to a playerbase
   vote.
   - The amendment must be approved via a 75% majority.
4. If approved, the amendment shall remain in force indefinitely.
