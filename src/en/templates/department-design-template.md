> Pillars are there to act as guides when creating new mechanics or interactions, they serve as the measuring posts to make sure that what you are trying to do will fit in the department gameplay. 

> To acheive this you want pillars that are concrete enough to get your concept across but broad enough that there is some room of interpretation and discussion.
