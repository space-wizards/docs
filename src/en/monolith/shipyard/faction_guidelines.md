# Faction Ship Design

## What is this?

Those are the mapping guidelines dedicated to general design of ships of specific factions. They are more loose, but should be followed along with the standard ship guidelines.

## TSF Ship Design
#### Technology and design
- Higher-tech feel and general technology level.
- Tech is generally TSF-origin.
- Ships that like to fly closer to the enemy and brawl while dodging, but will succumb to pressure once breached.
#### Weaponry
- Prefers energy weapons, some EMP, and fast-firing ballistics. Generally shorter range.
- Armament is almost entirely forward-focused, with few side and almost none, if any, backward firing arcs.
#### Internals
- Moderately but not prohibitively cramped on small to medium ships, not cramped on larger ships.
- Can have various non-vital luxury and bureaucracy rooms, especially on larger ships.
- Generally little to no redundant or backup systems on anything short of capitals.
- Good radar systems, good FTL, common shields even on smaller ships.
- Efficient power generation (Pinch, etc., as opposed to AME or similar).
#### Defense and mobility
- Bad internal armor.
- Lower moderate to moderate exterior armor, good frontal armor.
- Moderate to high thrust even on larger ships.

## PDV Ship Design
#### Technology and design
- Dated feel and general technology feel.
- Can use Syndicate tech, but sparingly.
- Rare or research-locked ships may have reverse-engineered high tech.
- Ships suitable for longer-range bombardment that can resist hull breaches, rotate to another side, and keep attacking, but are less convenient to operate.
#### Weaponry
- Prefers punchy lower-firerate ballistics and missiles. Common long-range weaponry.
- Armament generally has full or near-full firing arc coverage. Common broadside ships.
- Should have less guns be capable of facing any one direction at a given time.
#### Internals
- Highly cramped even on larger ships.
- Common redundant or backup systems, such as supply rooms, backup power generation (can include solar panel crates with solar control console flatpack), redundant wiring, or a second bridge on large vessels.
- Hull may have metal foam modules to automatically vacuum-seal itself on damage.
- Little, but some, flavor rooms.
- Rare shields.
#### Defense and mobility
- Good internal armor.
- Moderate to high armor depending on ship class, distributed across the whole exterior.
- Lower to moderate thrust, lower rotation rate.
