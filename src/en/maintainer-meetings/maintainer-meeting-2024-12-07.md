# QNA

## Will there be new midround ghostroles soon?
Theres a bunch of design docs and some prs, but we dont know when they will be merged.

## Will there be standardized design docs templates for feature design docs
This is something we want to work on in the design team but have not had time to implement it as of yet.

## Outcome of the voxbox stuff?
Voxboxes are to be removed from maps (Players can still make them). And as discussed in one of the prs above, they can self heal poison damage below 20 damage. Which also gives them an upside they really need.
