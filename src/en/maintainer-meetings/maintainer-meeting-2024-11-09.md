## Github organisation

### Triage
- Who gets triage role? What should they do?
    - Currently anyone who asks gets it, should we change it?
        - We should probably only hand it to expirienced contribs or trustworthy enough
    - We should have a triage policy for these contributors to follow
        - Ensure we communicate they CANT close prs
    - Should we use github projects?

- Speaking of expirienced contrib and maintainer?... who is CONSIDERED one?
    - Currently its just give it to people we think deserve it
        - We should have some kind of "requirement"
    - Basicly anyone who is friendly enough and we know is trustworthy enough and knows the codebase.
        - This should be a document
        
### Codeowners
We should clean it up, and maybe add some people.

- Codeowners should be used as the "The person here MUST review your pr to be approved"
    - Github has a branch protection rule to [require approval from any of the owners](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners#codeowners-and-branch-protection) to allow merging

- We should tag prs for each workgroup that gets added to prs

### Github pr/issue discussion
- It can be pretty common for people to cause trouble in issues/prs needing moderators and maintainers to come in and lock conversations or hide the comments.
    - Github moderation sucks and we cant just make it so that only contribs can communicate in comments but still make new prs or issues.
        - We may need to bite the bullet and make an automated system to be "added" so that people cant as easily drive by to complain. Similar to how unreal engine does 
        - This will also allows to "warn" users about their behevior
        - Moving to another git forge is NOT 
    - For issues its better we try to find a way to have a "subnautica report bug" button (julian had something?)
        - This will create an issue on a diffrent repo, and then can move it to the main repo after its reviewed.


## Somewhat sidetrack: Replays and stalking
- Hiding yourself from replays should be standardised
    - While the public replay browser hides maints/admins, its not preventing someone from just getting the source and running it themselves or just downloading the replay and seeing the replay_final.yml file
        - This can only really happen server side with a client setting

## Branches and hotfixes
- Hotfixes should be hotfixed into stable and then stable gets merged into master **WITH A REGULAR MERGE, NOT SQUASH**
    - We shouldn't have conflicts 
    - Github action?

## Test server
Currently, we run servers from the stable branch. Its gonna be nice to have.

- It has been decided miros will be the test server
- Potencial issue: It may make skipping role prerequisites easier
    - Example: On master we made cap require 5 hours command, but stable still needs 1 hour. Players can keep playing cap on stable while getting command time.
        - If we block time progression on test servers, players may not wanna play there.
            - Ask admins?
    - Sidetrack: OUR PLAYTIMES REQUIREMENTS SUCK
        - Per server roletimers?
            - Or per server multiplier?
    - Test server cvar?
    - Per server permissions so that maints can have limited admin access
        - Myra Sidetrack: Wait how is codermin/grafana role going?
            - Grafana is pii
            - SS14.Admin lets you login anyway even if pii is disabled on the admin.
    - How would we set it up?
        - Publish to a seperate branch, publish that to robustcdn. Easiest
        - Something in robustcdn to differentiate testing vs release

Pill bottles are designed to also hold other tiny objects like cigarettes, bullets, credits, etc.
The same applies to cig containers. They're also supposed to be able to hold small things, like the disk, lighters, etc"

## Random discussions
- Species should not be limited from eating, but there should maybe be a warning before you eat something "dangerous". Or while you are eating it.
    - I wanna eat chocolate as a lizard :(
    - This just further proves we need a species design doc
