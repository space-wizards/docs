## Test server

- V U L T U R E?
    - Sure!
- Is it a priotity given recent project occurrences?
    - Meh not really too hard to do, can't hurt.
- Requirements
    - Additions to game server to make it more clear that it's a test server
    - Popup when first joining server, bright yellow box in lobby UI? Something like that.
    - "You are playing on the test server! You'll get features first but beware bugs! This is how you can report them" that sorta thing.

- How to do it
    - Make a new publish workflow, do NOT run Discord/RSS Changelog pushes
    - PJB adds new fork to Robust.Cdn
        - Damn I am so glad I added this feature to Robust.Cdn :godo:
    - PJB configures Vulture watchdog to point to new fork.
    - Probably docs update on hosting tutorial too.

## Big congrats to the triage team!
- They have managed to triage all prs and issues!!
- WOOO

## PLEASE DO ADMIN PRS :3
- Yeah thats it
- https://github.com/orgs/space-wizards/projects/8

## Topics? What are those?
- Im filling the tables

## Should we review stable prs in game in meetings?
- Like someone just opens the game in the meeting to show off the features instead of showing off the link and going "sure" or "no"
    - Anything minor does not need to be reviewd like this
    - This should have been done ahead of time anyway in the review thread and before the meeting
    - Conclusion: We aitn doin it
