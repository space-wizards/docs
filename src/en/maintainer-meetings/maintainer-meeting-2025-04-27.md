## Game Audio Review (EmoGarbage)
The actual audio experience of playing the game has deteriorated to a level that's genuinely unplayable.

We need a few things:
- A comprehensive pass over basically all audio
- A freeze on new audio and sounds
    - Wouldn't a freeze paralyze most new additions? (Nik)
        - How many prs contain audio additions?
    - How long will it take?
        - A month ish
            - eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeh>>>!>!?!?!?!
- Better standards for how we define audio
- Updated docs for contribs on what we expect
- Better requirements for PRs to ensure things are in order

<br>

- Ensure PR's with audio should have a video of the audio playing in context
- Tag prs with audio changes
- Discourse was mentioned
- Test would be nice but we dont know how to make em lol
    - About the clipping: Its a neat idea but is that a common problem we have?
    - Also this is more of a "wyci"

## Improving / updating breaking change annoucements. (EletroSR)
See discussion around https://discord.com/channels/310555209753690112/900426319433728030/1365121905765388309

- The problem
    - People dont post breaking changes to github
    - The standards for what is considered a "Breaking change" are low and makes it hard for downstreams to filter
        - Currently "List any breaking changes, including namespaces, public class/method/field changes, prototype renames; and provide instructions for fixing them"
- Proposed solution
    - Just post em on github, no pinging on discord. A fork can just view the github discussions.
        - or DISCOURSE!!!!!!
        - We can bikeshed later where we want it.
            - NVM apparently we decided already :godo: discourse it is.
                - We will set a relay in the codebase changes channel from the forum.
    - Stricter standards on what is condiered "breaking"
        - A simple file rename or protype move is not enough.
        - We can talk about what this entails later.

## Mapping Changelog (ArtisticRoomba)
- I have submitted a PR which adds a mapping changelog in its own separate tab. Now that I'm a head mapper I can kick this back up.
- The changelog is desired by players and mappers who contribute to the game, and last I checked it was desired internally as well.
- I'm not sure what else is required beyond the PR in order to properly implement it, so I'm asking here right now.

<br>

- Before i could write anything the infra side was done by pjb now
    - So yeah its funded. Ship it.

## RSI meta.json attributions are merge conflict bait and difficult to maintain (ArtisticRoomba)
- Contributors have started to load RSIs full of states with little atomization (see toys.rsi)
- Copyright attribution is a single line on the entire file, so multiple PRs targeting an RSI have to resolve conflicts merge after merge (see toys.rsi)
- This sometimes leads to things getting accidentally dropped or lost in a conflict
- Usually new contributors are experiencing these problems (sprite changes, new items, etc.) so it's an unnecessary hassle when we have to teach them how to un-mess-something-up.
- A PR to update the schema to enable multi-state attribution was made however it is not the correct solution
- It was proposed to do per-file (not per-state) attribution in the meta.json, using something RGA-like
- Why not just use RGA, so we can use one standard we've already made?
- RSIEdit needs to have support to easily process and generate this stuff.
- Someone else has to tackle this issue as I genuinely do not know how to code C# for actual programs.

<br>

- Need this to be reviewed by PJB [35302](https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14/pull/35302) and thats only it apparently. Roomba was not present to add anything else.

## The TEG meta needs to be killed with really big hammers (ArtisticRoomba)
- While I am the TEG's biggest fan (terminal CE main) I have concluded that the current state of the TEG (lack of game mechanics and restrictions for atmos regarding the TEG) is straight up counterproductive to the game's health
- Players are discouraged from running regular engines due to the TEG's comparative lack of danger, superior runtime, and lack of maintenance
- Elite atmosians oftentimes shut down new players from doing engines or a TEG design of their own because they already have built a hyperoptimized setup by the 5 minute mark
- This directly conflicts against SS14's core design pillars regarding _Player Agency_
- Pipe bursting, delta-P window shattering, and other core game mechanics would limit the TEG, however those do not exist right now.
- We can kill the TEG by re-inspecting the radiator math (currently large delta-Ts can be accomplished by just one radiator, which is unrealistic) and nerfing radiator's radiation to space accordingly
- We can alternatively kill the TEG by drastically reducing the efficiency.
- We can instead encourage Atmosians to focus on Carnot efficiency (encouraging a continuous, hot burn, which common mini burn chamber designs are difficult at doing efficiently). However I think focusing on the first point is enough.
- Supermatter Soon Patent Pending Trademark? It adds an actual element of danger, keeping it in-line with all other engines, while allowing for very in-depth tinkering (if more gasses are real TM)

<br>

- We all agree this is good for the game already, and its not worth to go in depth in a maintainer meeting about this topic.
    - So yes, we should kill teg meta.

          - Could be cool if you could fax it if thats not already a feature.
          - Also means the clown cant just drain all of services money on toy boxes or something.
  - The cargo telepad needs to be nerfed as unlocking it trivializes gameplay (Roomba)
      - Everyone can basically make stuff appear in their department because they have the console
      - The cargo telepad is a holdover from an ancient state of SS14 where there was no ATS
      - Was moved to research as a tech
      - Unsure how it would even fit into current day SS14, it should probably be removed
      - The ATS needs to see discussion on how antagonists should interact with it (it can be killed pretty easily and cargo made unviable for the rest of the round)
      - See pull [34195](https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14/pull/34195)
          - The telepad should be removed when
              - The ATS console can't be destroyed by player grief. Or indestructible
              - Being able to just instantly bring items in is bad gameplay. And removes some intresting gameplay of flying and protecting the ATS.

- [34955](https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14/pull/34955) New Sprites for cables
    - There's a [PR](https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14/pull/32822) that changes the cable orientation so they're visible in more situations (previously they were commonly obstructed)
    - This PR is more for accessibility (colorblindness) reasons. But the sprite could use some more improvements in my opinion. (Slarti)

- [32796](https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14/pull/32796) make borgs require prying to open instead of screwing
  - I'm not a fan of this change. This just needlessy changes controls and will be confusing to players with no benefit. All wirepanels in the game are opened with a screwdriver and the examination text says it is a wirepanel. The argument was that in SS13 there is a wirepanel inside a hatch that you have to open first. But it makes no sense to change this until we actually implement that feature. Can we make a poll for reverting this? (Slarti)
      - Just keep it

- [34627](https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14/pull/34627) Agent -> Corpsman
  - Isn't the name "Agent" a SS13 classic? (Slarti)
      - Why not just call it the nukie medic
          - It does not sound cool... but it should be that.
          - "Medic Delta" does not have the same punch as "Corpsman Delta"
- [32426](https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14/pull/32426) ciggie sounds
- [33872](https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14/pull/33872) extend hotbar hotkeys to 20 keys via shift
  - I think if you do need more than 10 actions something already went significally wrong with UI design. I guess it's ok to have this for forks? (Slarti)
      - There may be a bug where its not properly listed in the keybinds menu. Acording to PJB.
- [36126](https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14/pull/36126) New Speech Indicators for species that don't have any.
- [34223](https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14/pull/34223) Updated air scrubber and air vent sprites.
  - I'm not a fan of the sprites. They look like deadly blade traps. These sprites are some of the most common ones in the game, usually you see multiple of them on your screen at all times. However, since 95% of players never need to interact with them they should stay in the background, but the new sprites pop out too much. In addition the status lights are less visible than before. I left a more detailed comment on github. (Slarti)
  - I second this (Roomba), the sprites clash visually with the general enviornment of the game. They're supposed to blend in, given that there's a lot of them, but they are very noisy and stick out. It doesn't match the game at all.
  - I do not like the sprites either, I agree with the concerns raised above (Milon)
      - Vote if we should revert these or just touch them up a bit further.
          - Or touch up the old ones a little. Like making the fan in the vent finny slower.
          - Note this has a few accessibility issues right now currently.
- [36492](https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14/pull/36492) Local Material Silo
    - Players can still take the silo into maints and succ lathes dry if they want to troll security or cargo (Roomba)
        - Keep it running as is. Worst case scenario we act on it later on.
            - Lilten made a video already wow

    - We've granted so many exceptions to the clothing freeze that we are ending up with the problem we are trying to prevent. We should actually enforce our freezes. (Roomba, also yes I am a part of this problem)
        - Turtlenecks may be an issue for head identification
        - Emo wants a revert, we will put it up to vote

    - We need to either put a pause on this or the chamelon pin to solve this needs to be real
    - Milon was working on UI antibloat for loadouts (Roomba)
    - I support Milon's loadout changes. There is also another PR doing the same right now, we should compare which one looks better. (Slarti)

  - The way it is currently implemented this is a giant wall of text no one will ever look at. It simply copies the copyright line for every single rsi. Causes lag when opened. And sloth mentioned credits still need to be updated manually, is that correct? (Slarti)
