## Release Procedures Proposal (Errant)
- Please read [the proposal](https://forum.spacestation14.com/t/maintainer-policy-change-release-procedure/20963) in advance and vote 
- Should the Release thread stay on Discord or move to the forum? Strong opinions in favor of both, so far
    - Discourse push notifications *can* allow fast communications
    - One Forum Channel for release could work
    
## What's up with all the rotatin'? (Slam)
- There's this very noticeable bug going on where items spawned from spawners are rotated, but all in the same direction.
- Further investigation seems to indicate they all spawn near (0.01~ precision) zero degrees world rotation.
- Decal Spawner PR in this Stable Merge seems to suffer from the same issue.
- EntityTable update caused this

## New Maptainer Spanky (Slam)
- Welcome! 
- the group meowing sessions start at 4pm GMT every day, be there or demotion

## Dissaproval Label Vibe Check
- its based

## New PR discussion system
- "i do like it"
- gives more formality 
- much more on topic
- "aysnc communication is better"
- ask again next meeting

## Stable review

    - no complaints

    - A monkey can already robust someone with just a crowbar, I'm a bit worried a kangaroo with a proper weapon will be even bigger of an issue. Though we have only Willow and thats mainly a skill issue ngl (Scar)

- [37756](https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14/pull/37756) Bar sign AlignTile version and fixtures for bar signs
    - **BLOCK**: I think this should be reverted, it sets a bad precedent. These are identical entities, except one is offset. There should just be a way to change the alignment of the bar sign via some action. (Wrenching? Since wallmounted stuff can't be unanchored anyway) Then in the future this solution could also be used for any other wallmounted entities, such as the television. `Errant`
    - keep only the aligned version, remove the other one (breaking change for downstreams)
        - VOTE!!
        - Revert (Keep Aligned Version (With migrations), remove other version as solution)
        - Keep

- [37834](https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14/pull/37834) Give cluwnes job icons
    - How does this effect borg laws?
    - "Unless a law redefines the definition of crew, then anyone who the HUD indicates to you has a job, including passengers, is a crewmember."
    - https://wiki.spacestation14.com/wiki/Silicon_Rules
    - Seems ok because it isn't a "job" - kind of like the zombie icon?
    - `Roomba` Players are already very confused on what is and isn't crew already. Cluwnes are supposed to be allowed to be hurt/gibbed so this is working backwards from what we want it to be and creates an inconsistency.
    - Falls under non-crew. That being said, there's the one PR [37038](https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14/pull/37038) that can alleviate it. (Slam)
        - is fine to merge

- [30924](https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14/pull/30924) Chameleon clothes + EMP behaviour
    - having it changed on server with ```component.NextEmpChange = _timing.CurTime + TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1f / component.EmpChangeIntensity);``` is a tiny bit scary, maybe slow down or make it Math.Min()? yes, it calls dirty. (Fildrance)
    - just limit it to avoid seizures
    - not a blocker, make a P2+ issue (or ping author)

- [37989](https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14/pull/37989) Adding a new trait: Monochromacy!
    - ideaguys but we could probably add colorblindness traits too at this point, would need to be in a new category in traits though (Scar)
- [38000](https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14/pull/38000) Added bulk cleanades crate
- [38004](https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14/pull/38004) Made C-4 Major contraband instead of syndicate contraband
    - I don't think this is a good one. C-4 is only possible to acquire as an antagonist (Traitor/Nukie/Thief), and the claim that it has other uses doesn't ring true to me. If this is found on someone's person, they have *professional* explosive equipment. (Slam)
    - There is an argument that Security could utilize C-4 for some sort of breach into AI/department, but that feels extremely situational, probably needlessly destructive, and push comes to shove there's researchable explosive charges/Warden's breaching charge. (Slam)

    - `Roomba` Lukewarm reminder to myself that cargo arbritarge will heisentest if the crate has a percent chance to have an item. Ex. a crate could bring something like a cheeseburger that makes it cost 50 dollars more at a 10% chance, which will fail tests at a 10% chance.

Weeks without non-squashed merges: 0 :cry: 
I am allowing you to publically shame anyone who is not squash merging (No /s here: DO at least tell the maintainer who didn't squash merge otherwise they will never know. Privately or staff chat idc just alert them.)
    - We have also updated the docs because it turns out squashing wasn't even written down anywhere :godo:
