## Maintainer meeting topics

### How do we do hotfixing properly

https://github.com/space-wizards/docs/pull/322
    - Should we Cherry pick? How do we avoid commit spaghetti?
    - Should we rebase or squash merge?

PJB here explained git visually. With some ideas on how to handle it, Look at the video to see the drawing

Decided workflow:
1. Make hotfix PRs against stable
2. Get PR merged via maintainer approved
3. Make PR to merge stable into master, clearly explaining what hotfix is being merged in.

When done like this, the only commits in the stable->master PR should be a "merge branch stable into master" merge commit, and the hotfix(es).

### How to handle hotfix changelogs

To recap, changelog generation effectively works in two stages:
1. PR bodies are parsed when merged, and "part" files are put into `Resources/Changelog/Parts`.
2. These part files are consumed and merged into the main `changelog.yml` file.

PJB's idea was to reconfigure the changelog bot to only run the second step on `stable`. PR body changelogs would be switched to start committing part files only, and those would be consumed when they're merged into stable. Changes to the `changelog.yml` done on stable for hotfixes wouldn't conflict with changes to `master`, ideally.
